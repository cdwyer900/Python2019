Belgium's privacy watchdog accused Facebook on Friday of trampling on European privacy laws by tracking people online without their consent and dodging questions from national regulators. The Privacy Protection Commission (CPVP/CBPL), which is working with German, Dutch, French and Spanish counterparts, launched the blistering attack after trying to find out more about the U.S. social media giant's practices. It urged Internet users to install privacy software to shield themselves from Facebook's tracking systems, whether they have an account with the social network or not. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic By Julia Fioretti BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU leaders on Thursday urged social networks to guarantee transparent practices and fully protect personal information as pressure piled on Facebook after allegations that data from 50 million of its users was mishandled. More than $50 billion has been wiped off Facebook's market value on reports that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters and influence the 2016 presidential election. "Social networks and digital platforms need to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens' privacy and personal data," the European Union heads of state said in after meeting in Brussels. "EU and national legislation must be respected and enforced." The harvesting of user data happened before a new EU data protection law comes into force under which companies could be fined up to 4 percent of global turnover for violating. "We cannot apply the sanctions which are coming with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) from May onwards," EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told reporters on Thursday. In Britain, which is leading the investigation from the European side, the maximum sanction is 500,000 pounds ($705,000), Jourova said, an insignificant amount compared to Facebook's $40.65 billion in revenue for 2017. European Parliament head Antonio Tajani invited Facebook's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to come to the legislature to explain "how Cambridge Analytica came to use the personal data of millions of people to influence the... U.S. presidential elections and the Brexit referendum." On Wednesday Zuckerberg apologised for mistakes his company made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to improve privacy protection. Jourova said more than one announcement would be needed to renew people's trust in Facebook. "This is much more serious because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality. It is endangering the free electoral choices of the people in Europe," she said.

[w1074] doctype  The Creator of the WhatsApp called to delete an account on Facebook - micetimes.asia  mobile menu top section socials close button login section menu section register/login section close button   Header style 10  LOGIN MODAL    Search      Science and technology The Creator of the WhatsApp called to delete an account on Facebook By paradox -  Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The reason for this was the scandal around Facebook. The founder of the popular messenger WhatsApp Brian Acton had urged followers in your social networks to remove Facebook. Any more details Acton did not lead and did not explain why “it’s time” to retire from the social network. “The time has come,” wrote Acton, adding the hashtag #deletefacebook. The reasons for this message Acton did not name, but a tweet came five days after the beginning of a series of publications in connection with the revelations about the abuse of user data Cambridge Analytica. Facebook purchased WhatsApp in 2014 for $16 billion Through this transaction, the creators of the messenger – Jan koum and Brian Acton – have become very rich people. Acton at the end of last year announced his departure from the company, where he worked for 8 years. Acton is not the first former head of Facebook, which expresses concern about the company after leaving it. Last year, former Vice President of Facebook’s growth, Camat of Palihapitiya stated that he feels enormous guilt for what he helped to create “tools that tear apart the social fabric and violate the principles of the society.” Interestingly, in February 2018, the founder of WhatsApp Brian Acton had invested $50 million in the development of secure messenger Signal. Thanks to funding from Acton the newly-formed Signal Foundation will be able to increase the application team, and change the vision of the programme. Add as the founder of social network Facebook Mark Zuckerberg fell by five billion dollars after hearing about the leak of user data.

The world's largest social media network is facing growing government scrutiny in Europe and the US about a whistleblower's allegations that London-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed user information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect US President Donald Trump in 2016. "This was a major breach of trust. I'm really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data," Mr Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN, breaking a public silence since the scandal erupted. Mr Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook the company "made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it." He said the social network planned to conduct an investigation of thousands of apps that have used Facebook's platform, restrict developer access to data, and give members a tool that lets them disable access to their Facebook data more easily.  His plans did not represent a big reduction of advertisers'ability to use Facebook data, which is the company's lifeblood.  Singapore Malaysia's Pedra Branca case 'very weak': Jayakumar Jun 01, 2018 Mr Zuckerberg said he was open to additional government regulation and happy to testify before the US Congress if he was the right person. "I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated," he told CNN. "I actually think the question is more what is the right regulation... People should know who is buying the ads that they see on Facebook." Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook was committed to stopping interference in the US midterm election in November and elections in India and Brazil. - REUTERS Get The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App Store  or Google Play Store now WORLD li class="share-count"> Shares

You know, that social network that only Baby Boomers seem to use now? It somehow has more than two-billion users at present, and that number for data collection firms is a goldmine just waiting to be ravaged. Speaking of which, one particular company through a series of ducks, dips, dives and dodges, has garnered a hefty slice of this information. Here’s what you need to know about the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook data siphoning fiasco. What is Cambridge Analytica? Cambridge Analytica is a privately-owned firm based in London, England, but has satellite offices in Malaysia, Brazil, and the US. It was created on the final day of 2013, and focusses on data collection and analytics for companies (doing, uh, data things) and politicians running election campaigns. It’s the latter that has people outraged this week. “CA Political has redefined the relationship between data and campaigns. By knowing your electorate better, you can achieve greater influence while lowering overall costs,” it writes on its website. Cambridge Analytica came to prominence in 2015 when it aided the data collection for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign (for which it was paid US$750 000 ). Cruz, if you remember correctly, still lost. But in 2016, it finally found a winner with then-Republican candidate Donald Trump. It was a force behind his presidential campaign. The firm also reportedly played a role during the 2016 Brexit referendum, and a number of other campaigns closer to home. But we’ll get into those a little later. Other notables includes its staffers. Steve Bannon, former Chief Strategist of the Trump administration and co-founder of right-wing publication Breitbart, was Cambridge Analytica’s vice president. And in terms of investment, Republican donor Robert Mercer dropped cash into Cambridge Analytica’s coffers too. What did it do, and how was Facebook involved? On 17 March 2018, the New York Times and the UK’s The Observer published a joint report revealing that Cambridge Analytica collected the data of some 50-million users on Facebook through an app. Not an Android or iOS app; an app from within Facebook, like those annoying quizzes, games and surveys. The app dubbed “ thisisyourdigitallife ” was billed as a personality profile, and allowed its creator, Russian Cambridge University professor Aleksandr Kogan, to garner data, and pass it on to Cambridge Analytica through its owner Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL). The basis of apps within Facebook was made possible in 2007, when the company launched the Facebook Platform; effectively a framework on which apps can be built and can make use of social information in your profile. Facebook didn’t break the news to the publications, and instead it was whistleblower and former Cambridge Analytica contractor Christopher Wylie who revealed the trail of spilled data on the floor. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on,” Wylie told The Observer. How many users have been affected? Although the app was only downloaded by 270 000 users according to Facebook, the app could gain data from users’ friends if their Facebook privacy settings allowed. Most estimates suggest that 50-million Facebook users have been targetted, and sheds light on how your friends on the social network can also be your worst enemies. Why was ‘this’ instance of data collection wrong? While collecting data through social media activity is nothing new — hell, Facebook does it as it chases you across the web with those advertising offers — this particular collection of data was enabled through an academic license awarded to Kogan. But it wasn’t entirely used for academic purposes. Facebook in a statement also resisted calling the scam a “data breach” as referred to by the New York Times and The Observer, but failed to suggest that it was in control or aware of the situation prior to the report’s surfacing. Nevertheless, it did say that Kogan violated the firm’s Platform Policies by “passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe”. “Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies,” Facebook continued. While Cambridge Analytica’s role can’t be downplayed, Facebook ultimately awarded Kogan the academic license after he requested it from the social network. And it failed to tell users that their data was at risk . Who is Facebook blaming? Uh, definitely not Facebook. Instead, the company is pointing the finger at every other party but itself, including users. “Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” it victim blamed . Facebook also called out Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and whistleblower Wylie. Suspended by @facebook . For blowing the whistle. On something they have known privately for 2 years. pic.twitter.com/iSu6VwqUdG — Christopher Wylie (@chrisinsilico) March 18, 2018 It has since suspended Wylie’s Facebook account, and barred Cambridge Analytica and related parties from the social network. Cambridge Analytica is however pleading its innocence. Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service. We are in touch with Facebook now and can confirm that we do not hold or use any data from profiles https://t.co/YD8kFXCFTL — Cambridge Analytica (@CamAnalytica) March 17, 2018 “Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service. We are in touch with Facebook now and can confirm that we do not hold or use any data from profiles,” it tweeted. What about Mark Zuckerberg? Jessie Eisenberg had Justin Timberlake to lean on in The Social Network , but Mark Zuckerberg does what he always does: he wrote a Facebook post . The founder and CEO however did take full responsibility for the issue, going against the statement mentioned in the previous section, written by Paul Grewal, Facebook’s VP and deputy general counsel. “I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I’m responsible for what happens on our platform. I’m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.” How are Facebook users responding? Even with this heartfelt post published, Facebook users are turning on the social network. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook began trending this week on Twitter after the story broke, as users across the world were made aware of the scandal. Prominent tech figures like WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton led the call. That’s a bold move Cotton, especially considering that WhatsApp is owned by Facebook. It is time. #deletefacebook — Brian Acton (@brianacton) March 20, 2018 Whistleblower and all-round tech skeptic Edward Snowden called Facebook “accomplices” in a scathing tweet. “Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims. They are accomplices,” he wrote. Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims. They are accomplices. https://t.co/mRkRKxsBcw — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 17, 2018 Others Twitter users called into question Facebook’s ability to track users across the web. Ever notice that when you look up something on the internet, let’s say cars for sale or hotels, you start getting Facebook ads on the same subject? Facebook tracks you even when you’re not on Facebook. #DeleteFacebook — Viva La Resistance (@TrumpsBrain) March 22, 2018 Some noted that you should delete all Facebook services if you “really and honestly believe in this #DeleteFacebook” hashtag. You should also delete Whatsapp and Instagram if you really and honestly believe in this #DeleteFacebook movement/trend. — Nayantara Rai (@NayantaraRai) March 21, 2018 Others wondered what good deleting Facebook now, over 13 years since its inception, would do. Should I delete my Facebook account? So, should you? That’s a question that could be covered in its own detailed article, but here’s what we say. “If former Facebook executives, including the co-founder of WhatsApp, are saying you should delete Facebook, well… that says it all, doesn’t it?” Gearburn editor Hadlee Simons tells me. “It’s given me pause for thought because this misuse of data was so blatant. Our social media profiles are essentially being weaponised and Facebook was apparently okay with it — until negative press occurred.” Ventureburn’s Daniel Mpala shares the same views. “The whole Cambridge Analytica scandal shows that Facebook does not have control over data that outside developers have access to. What’s worrying is Facebook has rules on data but it seems the company is not actively enforcing them. The Cambridge Analytica incident is the only one that’s come to the fore, what about the other stuff we don’t yet know about?” “I am going to be taking heed of Brian Acton’s comments and will delete my account,” he concludes. For me, I have to agree with my colleagues. But the question then is, what about your other social networks? Cambridge Analytica has also influenced elections closer to home in both Nigeria and Kenya . How long until, say, South Africa is added to the growing list? How can I delete my Facebook account? There are two very clear distinctions you need to understand when it comes to deleting your Facebook account. You can either “disable” your account, which leaves it alive for when you feel the urge to post again but removes you from timelines, searches and renders your profile page invisible to others. And then there’s actually deleting your account, which renders your account completely trashed and unrecoverable but only after a “a few days after it’s requested”. To delete your account, visit this link . It will take up to 90 days for Facebook to realise that you’re serious, and to scrub its servers of “all of the things you’ve posted, like your photos, status updates or other data stored in backup systems.” You may want to download a copy of your data before you delete you account. Head over to “Settings”, “General Account Settings” and click “Download a copy of your Facebook data”. If I don’t want to delete Facebook, how can I stop it from garnering information about me? If you can’t delete your account — perhaps you manage a business page — we suggest you remove all apps from your Facebook account. Yes, that includes Farmville , and any other game you have installed to your profile. Be sure to remove Facebook’s access to your other services as well, including services like Zomato and others. If you don’t want Facebook to track you across the web, log in from the same browser or browser profile every day, and delete the cache and cookies at the end of each session. Don’t use this browser for anything else. Additionally, you may want to run a tracking bug blocker or cookie cleanup extension to prohibit Facebook from suggesting those shoes you really want in advertisements. Or, hell, if you can just stop using the internet entirely. Throw all your hardware in a dumpster. Set it on fire. And live out the remainder of your life deep the forest armed with a sharp stick. Even if you can stop Facebook from following you around the internet, it doesn’t mean that other companies won’t (or don’t) take its place.

In a separate statement posted on the social-media platform he founded, Zuckerberg acknowledged that “mistakes” were made, adding “there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it”. “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” he said referring to Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University researcher who created an app that collected personal data of users, and then sold the information to the data mining company linked to Trump. “It was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.” READ MORE:  Mastercard uses Facebook Messenger to help small businesses go digital Zuckerberg was forced to apologise following reports that the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an independent goverment body governing privacy policies, is looking into whether Facebook violated a 2011 rules on consent. If Facebook is found to have violated the terms of the consent decree, the FTC can fine the social network more than $40 000 a day per violation. Cambridge Analytica controversy The UK’s privacy regulator, the Information Commissioner’s office, said on Monday it would request a  warrant  to search the offices of the political consultancy. Cambridge Analytica stands accused of using data  mined  from Facebook in the voter research it conducted for President Donald Trump during the 2016 elections campaign. Facebook’s price at the stock market also fell following the revelation. An undercover investigation by the UK-based Channel 4 revealed that Cambridge Analytica may have engaged in ethically and legally questionable practices. The firm’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, was approached by an undercover reporter posing as a fixer for a potential client.

Nix has since been suspended. Mark Turnbull, Cambridge Analytica’s MD for political operations, said that once information is published online, the team will ensure that the content remains relevant. In his statement late on Wednesday, Zuckerberg vowed to fix policies at Facebook to prevent similar breaches in the future. “At the end of the day, I’m responsible for what happens on our platform,” he said. “We wil learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.” – Al Jazeera Tags: Facebook , mark zuckerberg  Related articles Facebook murder: Zolile Khumalo murder-accused smiles in the dock Facebook launches Marketplace in South Africa Facebook fined R1,6bn over WhatsApp deal UK: Facebook deletes tens of thousands of fake news accounts Live Chats An hour of mentorship with Khanyi Dhlomo An hour of mentorship with Khanyi Dhlomo An Hour of Mentorship with Khanyi Dhlomo An hour of mentorship with Khanyi Dhlomo Latest On DESTINY Magazine Lifestyle Positions that will keep you warm between the sheets this winter  News Guptas have 5 days to return plane to Lanseria airport  News Retailer MRP’s headline earnings up 21,1%  News South Africans will soon be safe – Police Minister Bheki Cele Popular on DESTINY Magazine Advice 5 things you don’t owe your boss Lifestyle Five signs you’re dating a con artist News Two girls found hanged at North West school News WSU student Sibongile Mani has been released with a warning after first court appearance Sign up to our newsletters!

[w1081] Zuckerberg finally speaks on Cambridge Analytica scandal: He's willing to testify to Congress and thinks tech should be regulated - Tech - Pulse.ng    Blick-Kanal (bolzurich) Sport-Kanal (blicksport) bu: https://www.pulse.ng/    Start Google Tag Manager Google Tag Manager BI noscript tag End Google Tag Manager  Pulse.ng logo       Go   Finance Lifestyle Politics Sports Strategy Tech Go to Pulse.ng     Tech 								Zuckerberg finally speaks on Cambridge Analytica scandal: He's willing to testify to Congress and thinks tech should be regulated Published: 22.03.2018 Print eMail 				The Facebook CEO says the question with regulating tech isn't "if" but "how." markzuck (Facebook)  Tweet  24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!  24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!  news Days into the Cambridge Analytica scandal rocking Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally broke his silence and went on a media blitz on Wednesday. The #DeleteFacebook movement was growing, and the company&apos;s stock was taking a hit. Zuckerberg apologized, said he was willing to testify before Congress, said he thought big tech should be regulated, and explained how Facebook was trying to protect user data. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence on the data scandal that rocked the social network over the weekend and has sent its stock diving this week. To follow up on an earlier statement, Zuckerberg also participated in a rare series of interviews with the press on the matter: a televised sit-down with CNN along with printed interviews in Wired , The New York Times , and Recode . Notably, in several of these interviews he actually apologized, saying "sorry" — a word that was conspicuously absent from his Facebook post earlier in the day. The scandal centers on the British data company Cambridge Analytica , which has ties to Donald Trump&apos;s 2016 presidential campaign and which illicitly obtained information from as many as 50 million Facebook profiles by abusing Facebook&apos;s data-sharing features. In his round of interviews, Zuckerberg mainly reiterated points from his statement: Facebook regrets what happened and has already taken steps designed to prevent it from happening again. Still, the devil is in the details, and in the interviews Zuckerberg also revealed a lot about the way he and Facebook were thinking about the situation. Here are some highlights: Zuckerberg is happy to testify to Congress "if it&apos;s the right thing to do," he told CNN . He expounded on this to Wired, saying he was willing to testify personally but would rather leave it to Facebook&apos;s legal and technical experts, who could speak with more authority on the situation. He told The New York Times that the #DeleteFacebook movement that sprang up around the scandal hadn&apos;t seen "a meaningful number of people" act on it but that it was still " not good ." He continued: "I think it&apos;s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people , and I understand that." Zuckerberg believes that tech should be regulated : "The question isn&apos;t &apos;Should there be regulation or shouldn’t there be?&apos; It’s &apos;How do you do it?&apos;" he told Wired . He said he supported regulating tech but was wary of "micromanagement" of free speech by governments. (He expressed explicit support for the Honest Ads Act, a US bill that would require more transparency around advertising if passed.) Zuckerberg told Recode more about the audits Facebook planned to perform on app developers that could have abused user data as Cambridge Analytica did. Facebook will need to analyze tens of thousands of apps at a cost of "many millions of dollars," he said — plus, it needs to hire qualified auditors. All told, it&apos;s a rare look at how the CEO of the world&apos;s most successful social platform is looking at its power — and its responsibility.

Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix gives evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee. (Parliament TV)  Tweet  24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!  24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!  news British politicians have summoned the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, to explain contradictions around whether his firm used Facebook data to target voters. Nix told MPs in February that the firm does not use or hold Facebook data. But that was belied by reports last week that Cambridge Analytica had illegitimately access millions of Facebook profiles through an app intended for search. British politicians have summoned the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, to explain why he keeps contradicting himself about the way his firm used Facebook data. Damian Collins, the Conservative politician overseeing a select committee enquiry into fake news, wrote to Nix: "[There] are a number of inconsistencies in your evidence to us of 27 February, notably your denial that your company received data from the Global Science Research company. We are also interested in asking you again about your claim that you "do not work with Facebook data, and [...] do not have Facebook data." He added: "Giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter. We urge you to come forward and explain your comments..." Nix last appeared at the fake news select committee enquiry in February, mostly to explain — or not explain — how Cambridge Analytica was involved in 2016&apos;s Leave.EU campaign. But he also denied earlier media reports that the firm had used Facebook data to show voters highly targeted political advertising, both for the US presidential election in 2016 and during the Brexit vote. At the time, he said : "We do not work with Facebook data, and we do not have Facebook data. We do use Facebook as a platform to advertise, as do all brands and most agencies, or all agencies, I should say. We use Facebook as a means to gather [opinion] data. We roll out surveys on Facebook that the public can engage with if they elect to." He later added: "People are not giving us consent and Facebook does not have a mechanism that allows third parties such as us to access its data on its customers." In other words, Nix explicitly denied that Cambridge Analytica took data belonging to Facebook users without their consent. But his evidence is now contradicted by reports last week that Cambridge Analytica did access 50 million profiles without consent , by buying the data from an academic researcher which gathered the information through a Facebook app. The revelations caused an uproar: Facebook has banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform while it investigates, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologised publicly , and Nix was suspended from his role . It&apos;s certain that Nix will be asked to explain the inconsistencies in his evidence if he agrees to appear before the committee. You can read all the other times Cambridge Analytica has contradicted itself here, and an explanation of what the firm does here .

Published: 22.03.2018 Print eMail  Alexandra Kleeman, a writer who grew up with social media, at home in New York, March 21, 2018. She removed the Facebook app from her phone after hearing that the personal data of 50 million users had wound up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, but she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram. (Joshua Bright/The New York Times) googleoff: index googleon: index  Tweet  24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!   24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!  news But the news that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10,000 times on Twitter within a two-hour period Wednesday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. On Tuesday, it was mentioned 40,398 times, according to the analytics service Digimind. Cher was one such deserter, writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook, although “very hard,” was necessary because she loves the United States. Brian Acton, a co-founder of the WhatsApp messaging service, told his tens of thousands of followers Tuesday to delete Facebook. The social network acquired WhatsApp in a $19 billion deal in 2014. For people who aren’t celebrities or billionaires, the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly, because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives, friends and professional opportunities. Here, some newly Facebook-free users of social media discuss why they left and how they plan to cope. — Richard H. Perry A filmmaker in Los Angeles For a long time now, Perry had wanted to leave Facebook. He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information. In the months before the 2016 presidential election, he watched the social network become what he called “a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists.” But Facebook was also where Perry promoted his films, where he posted ads seeking help on the set, and where he communicated with colleagues and a “massive number” of his friends and relatives. Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica. “I suspected this stuff was going on, but this is the first time it’s been plainly exposed,” he said. “It seems so malicious, and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down, like it doesn’t care about its users.” Perry, 39, has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs. “It was an easy decision,” he said. “It’s not going to be the end of the world.” — Dan Clark A retired Navy veteran in Maine Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends from all over the world and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide. This week, he deleted both accounts. “Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them, and it was a difficult decision to give it up,” he said. “But you have to stand for something, so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough.” Clark, 57, said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts, which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were “never evil or putting anybody down.” He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent. Before cutting the cord, Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number. More than 100 people reached out within three days. “There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact: phones, email, instant message, Gab, which is a social network that doesn’t censor anything,” he said. “Facebook is more obsolete than people would think.” — Alexandra Kleeman A writer in Staten Island, New York Her first experience with fake news — a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump’s candidacy — altered the way Kleeman looked at Facebook. “It changed the psychological and emotional feel of the platform for me,” she said. “I don’t have a great feeling when I log in.” The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone. “I’m not going to give them my engagement clicks,” Kleeman, 32, said. But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram. She doesn’t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public — she used to have a blog, she said. “But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don’t want, that freaks me out.” — Paul Musgrave An assistant professor in Amherst, Massachusetts Twitter makes Musgrave feel depressed about the world, but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon. As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Musgrave, 36, feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets. Facebook was more valuable to him as a “low-key, offstage networking tool,” a “replacement for end-of-year family newsletters” that allowed him to “passively keep up with people,” he said. He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster, a precursor to Facebook. But in 2016, while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana, Musgrave discovered a “poisonous swamp” of content on the site. The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing, he said. “This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us, truly Big Brother-level, but it’s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication,” he said. “That’s what’s really been scary.” Having deactivated his Facebook account, with plans to delete it completely, he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication. “I’m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches,” he said. “I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones, and even they don’t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces.” — Ben Greenzweig An entrepreneur in Westchester, New York Once Greenzweig confirms that the 1,195 photos and 85 videos in his Facebook profile have downloaded, he plans to delete the account he has maintained for nearly a decade. Greenzweig, 40, said the Cambridge Analytica news was “the last straw.” “We have surpassed the tipping point, where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost,” he said. “But I will definitely miss what the promise of Facebook used to be — a way to connect to community in a very global and local context.” A year ago, Greenzweig was an “extraordinarily active” Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends, managed several groups, took out ads for his business, maintained professional contacts and even developed a trial chatbot function on the platform. But Tuesday night, in his final post, he asked his network to connect with him through email, LinkedIn, Twitter or phone. “See everyone in the real world,” he wrote.

The Guardian of UK reports that the data analytics firm that worked on the Donald Trump election campaign was offered material from Israeli hackers who had accessed the private emails of two politicians, including President Muhammadu Buhari. Multiple sources have described how senior directors of Cambridge Analytica – including its chief executive, Alexander Nix – gave staff instructions to handle material provided by computer hackers in election campaigns in Nigeria and St Kitts and Nevis. They claim there were two episodes in 2015 that alarmed members of staff and led them to refuse to handle the data, which they assumed would have been obtained illegally. SCL Elections, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, denied taking possession of or using hacked or stolen personal information from such individuals for any purpose in either campaign. The revelations are the latest to focus attention on Cambridge Analytica, whose activities are being investigated in the US by the special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible Russian collusion in the 2016 US presidential election. The firm is under pressure to explain how it came to have unauthorised access to millions of Facebook profiles. Politicians in the US and UK have accused it of giving misleading statements about its work, and the information commissioner has demanded access to the company’s databases. In all, the Guardian and Observer has spoken to seven individuals with knowledge of Cambridge Analytica and its campaign in Nigeria in early 2015. Hired by a Nigerian billionaire to support the re-election of Goodluck Jonathan, Cambridge Analytica was paid an estimated £2m to orchestrate a ferocious campaign against his rival, the opposition leader Muhammadu Buhari. Jonathan lost out to Buhari in the presidential race. There is no suggestion Jonathan knew of the covert operation. Staff working on the campaign say in early 2015 they met Israeli cybersecurity contractors in Cambridge Analytica’s offices in Mayfair, London. Employees say they were told the meeting was arranged by Brittany Kaiser, a senior director at the firm. The Guardian and Observer have been told the Israelis brought a laptop from their office in Tel Aviv and handed employees a USB stick containing what they believed were hacked personal emails. Sources said Nix, who was suspended on Tuesday, and other senior directors told staff to search for incriminating material that could be used to damage opposition candidates, including Buhari. “It made everyone feel really uncomfortable,” said one source. “They wanted people to load it into their email programs.” People “freaked out”, another employee said. “They wanted to have nothing to do with it.” One member of the campaign team told the Guardian and Observer that the material they believed had been hacked included Buhari’s medical records. “I’m 99% sure of that. Or if they didn’t have his medical records they at least had emails that referred to what was going on.” When news of the London meeting filtered back to Cambridge Analytica staff working on the ground in Nigeria, it caused panic, the source said. Local security advisers told the firm’s team to leave the country immediately because if opposition supporters found out, they could turn on them. “What is clear is that the security of their employees didn’t even seem to have occurred to them,” said one former employee. “It was a very serious situation and they had to evacuate immediately.” An SCL Elections spokesperson said team members working on the Nigeria campaign remained in the country throughout the original campaigning period, and left in accordance with the company’s campaign plan. The Guardian has seen an email from Nix dated 26 January 2015, referring to the “Israeli team”. It says: “Although it is outside of our remit, I have asked for an update on what the Israeli team has been working on and what they will be delivering between now and the election.” In a second episode in early 2015, sources said the same Israeli team that had worked on the Nigeria campaign obtained private information of the St Kitts and Nevis politician Timothy Harris. At the time he was an opposition leader, and is now prime minister. Sources have said staff did not want to handle what appeared to be stolen material. “Nobody wanted to have anything to do with it,” one employee said. A statement from SCL Elections said: “During an election campaign, it is normal for SCL Elections to meet with vendors seeking to provide services as a subcontractor. SCL Elections did not take possession of or use any personal information from such individuals for any purposes. SCL Elections does not use ‘hacked’ or ‘stolen’ data.” The statement added: “Members of the SCL Elections team that worked on the Nigeria campaign remained in country throughout the original campaigning period, although the election was rescheduled and SCL was not retained for the entirety of the extended campaign period. “Team members left in accordance with the company’s campaign plan. Team members were regularly briefed about security concerns prior to and during deployment and measures were taken to ensure the team’s safety throughout.” The revelations will add to the questions facing Cambridge Analytica and the techniques it uses to influence elections for its clients. In the UK, the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office are investigating the firm for breaches of electoral and data protection law.

And companies are buying and selling that information to target you. (Kim Komando) googleoff: index googleon: index 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!   24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!  news Over the past few days, a whistleblower has revealed how the now-infamous Cambridge Analytica used data from Facebook users without their permission, inciting calls for people to #DeleteFacebook. Pink-haired and wearing a septum ring, Christopher Wylie is the whistleblower who has uncovered the biggest scandal in Facebook&apos;s history. According to a series of articles released by him, a data company, Cambridge Analytica manipulated data belonging to millions of users. The data was collected via a Facebook personality quiz, " thisisyourdigitallife ", provided by Global Science Research which was answered by tens of thousands of people. They were not the only victims. Answering the quiz required the user to grant certain permissions, which effectively gave the company access to the data from their Facebook friends. Cambridge Analytica acquired this data from Global Science Research, and in turn, used it to develop models that it used to manipulate the United States &apos; elections in 2016. Let Christopher Wylie tell it, " We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on " Christopher Wylie has revealed that Cambridge Analytica was able to secure information on 50 million Facebook profiles, (The Georgia Straight) There are different implications to this. But it means one thing: Facebook has access to your data and companies and governments are using it to influence you. An expose by Guardian UK uncovered how a senior director of Cambridge Analytica was approached by an unnamed Nigerian billionaire to influence the 2015 elections in favour of the incumbent, Goodluck Jonathan . The company settled on creating a video depicting President Buhari as a leader who would enforce sharia law throughout the country. The project was called off after the company&apos;s presence in Nigeria was compromised and its operatives had to leave the country. Whether privacy is such a big deal for you is a personal decision. Many people have already chosen what side they&apos;re on; here are some reasons why they believe it&apos;s a good idea to delete Facebook. 1. Facebook knows too much about you: When Facebook first appeared on our radars, most of us were ecstatic because of the opportunities it created to help us meet new friends and explore our relationships with existing ones. That optimism and the friendly promise of social networking made us open up ourselves literally. We were (and still are) eager to provide information, answer quizzes and later, link our facebook account to just about every app we use. Facebook stores data in data centers that look like this. There are nearly a dozen of them around the world. (Fortune) ALSO READ: 7 things you should know about Cambridge Analytica&apos;s role in the 2015 elections The effect is that Facebook has way too much information about its users. In today&apos;s world, it&apos;s a very scary prospect. 2. The data is being used to manipulate you: You know that thing that happens when you read about music for a while and log in to your Facebook, to be bombarded with ads promoting earphones, new albums and music players. It&apos;s called targeted advertising and it&apos;s one of the most important tools for businesses in the world we live in today.Brands and companies pay tech giants like Facebook and Google to help them target adverts at people who have shown an interest in similar products. ALSO READ: Israeli hackers gave Cambridge Analytica the stolen private emails of two world leaders These companies use the data in their grasp to achieve this. The question though is, what happens when this data is used for ulterior motives, like convincing people to vote for a particular candidate by targeting their fear of religious crisis. The risk that data can be used to manipulate users is one of the most real concerns of this century. These Cambridge Analytica revelations show it has been happening for years. 3. Facebook is ...old: It seems like such a long time ago when Facebook was ground zero for just about everything. Nothing really pops on Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s social platform anymore. Mark Zuckerberg has apologised for the scandal. (REUTERS/Shu Zhang) I haven&apos;t made any new friends there in ages. The friend requests are occasional and when they do come, it is from a random teenager in Kwara State who I share another little-known mutual friend with. When news breaks or conversation are ignited nowadays, it usually happens on Twitter. ALSO READ: Facebook can still track you, even if you delete your account; here&apos;s how to stop it You may have to wait two or three days before Facebook picks up the ashes. As the first generation to use social networks on this scale, we never really had an idea how long any of them would last. If all social networks came with a self-destruct button, Facebook has been cuddling its own for a while now.

[w1087] #DeleteFacebook Controversy: Facebook says it's Cracking Down on Platform Abuse  - BellaNaija  [if lt IE 9]> endif] BellaNaija Nigeria breaking & top news to the World 24/7. Read Today #DeleteFacebook Controversy: Facebook says it’s Cracking Down on Platform Abuse  at 10:21 am By Facebook has said that it is cracking down on abuse of its platform by third party companies or developers. This is in response to the controversy that resulted from the discovery that  Cambridge Analytica , a political data analytics firm that worked on ads for  Donald Trump ‘s 2016 elections campaign, misused data. The social networking platform’s stocks had dropped 7%, resulting in a $37 billion loss. The company had lied about deleting data sent to it by the makers of a popular psychology test app, “thisisyourdigitallife.” About 270,000 had registered to use the app created by  University of Cambridge  psychology professor,  Aleksandr Kogan , Facebook wrote, who then passed their information and the information of friends whose privacy settings allowed it to Cambridge Analytica. The data gotten was used to target ads for Donald Trump,  CNBC  had reported. This has led to a #DeleteFacebook campaign on Twitter, with WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton lending his voice. “What happened with Cambridge Analytica was a breach of Facebook’s trust. More importantly, it was a breach of the trust people place in Facebook to protect their data when they share it,” Facebook said in a blog post. In other to prevent this from happening again, Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg , in a post on the platform, said in part: First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. Second, we will restrict developers’ data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse. For example, we will remove developers’ access to your data if you haven’t used their app in 3 months. Third, we want to make sure you understand which apps you’ve allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you’ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps’ permissions to your data. I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I’m responsible for what happens on our platform. I’m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn’t change what happened in the past. We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward. Facebook, in its blog post also said it will henceforth: Review our platform Tell people about data misuse Turn off access for unused apps Restrict Facebook Login data Encourage people to manage the apps they use Reward people who find vulnerabilities.

He posted the photo in 2016 Tuesday to celebrate Instagram growing to 500 million users . But the photo has taken new meaning after Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday for a scandal in which British data company Cambridge Analytica , which has ties to Donald Trump&apos;s 2016 presidential campaign, illicitly obtained information from as many as 50 million Facebook profiles by abusing Facebook&apos;s data-sharing features. From the Instagram photo, it&apos;s clear that Zuckerberg takes his own personal privacy very seriously. Just take a look: null (Facebook) Enhance: null (Facebook) On the laptop, it definitely looks like Zuckerberg has placed tape over the MacBook&apos;s camera. Going even further, it looks as if he&apos;s taped over the laptop&apos;s microphone, as well, Chris Olson pointed out on Twitter . It looks like that&apos;s Zuckerberg&apos;s desk and his laptop, because he&apos;s posted videos from there before. It&apos;s also ironic given that Facebook is frequently accused by conspiracy theorists that it&apos;s listening in on private conversations. Zuckerberg joins other hacker luminaries who tape over their webcams, including former FBI director James Comey and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. They say the move isn&apos;t paranoid — it&apos;s prudent. But if you&apos;re a billionaire with millions of fans and critics, like Zuckerberg , then you might be a little paranoid, too.

They showed either a chief executive getting on top of the situation, and making what sounded like significant concessions in areas we wouldn't expect. Or, it was a skilled, composed display of PR spin - a media appearance for which he had almost six days to prepare. Speaking to CNN's Laurie Segall , Mr Zuckerberg made it look like he was giving up a lot, while simultaneously dodging the big issues. /1002554/Myjoyonline/mjo-article-leaderboard_mid Yes, he said he welcomed more regulation - but in a way that wouldn't have that much impact on Facebook's business at all. Yes, he said he would be "happy" to testify before Congress and other committees around the world - but immediately gave himself the get-out clause he has used to avoid all of the other hearings so far. Yes, he did say sorry - but only for the situation, not specifically for the actions of his company. Simply - Mr Zuckerberg did enough to buy some time as he tries to get his company in order, but not much more than that. /1002554/Myjoyonline/mjo-article-leaderboard_mid His comment - "I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated" - seemed like a major admission that the time may have come for stricter rules on his business. In reality, he was advocating for a bill that would arguably have more impact on the people who advertise on Facebook than Facebook itself. "I think there are things like ads transparency regulation that I would love to see," he told CNN. /1002554/Myjoyonline/mjo-article-leaderboard_mid He was referring to the Honest Ads Act that's being debated by US politicians right now, a proposed law that would force buyers of any online advertising relating to candidates in an election campaign to be more transparent about funding. In other words, the internet equivalent of messages like "I'm Donald Trump and I support this message" being tacked to TV spots. The Honest Ads Act would also require companies like Facebook to take "reasonable" steps to determine that no foreign power was buying ads. Here's what's worth knowing: following the fall-out over Russian-bought ads in the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook said it created the tools needed to handle political ad spending better. So if the Honest Ads Act was passed today, chances are Facebook would already be in compliance. /1002554/Myjoyonline/mjo-article-leaderboard_mid Dodged hearings In the days following the Cambridge Analytica revelations, several investigatory committees in the US and Europe said they would be calling on Mr Zuckerberg to testify in person. "The short answer is I'm happy to," he told CNN. "If it's the right thing to do." This has been Mr Zuckerberg's position all along. In the past, he's sent people like lawyer Colin Stretch, who took the lion's share of questions when the social media companies were summoned to Washington late last year. When it wasn't lawyers, the company opted to send specific department heads, such as policy boss Monika Bickert. But to be fair to Facebook, this is a valid approach. If ​Mr Zuckerberg is a good boss capable of delegating effectively, his department heads would certainly know more about their respective areas than he would. It's worth remembering that when it comes to political theatre, those calling Mr Zuckerberg to Washington would enjoy very much the chance to look tough and impressive when dealing with a powerful tech leader. "That's not a media opportunity - or at least it's not supposed to be," Mr Zuckerberg told CNN. "We just want to make sure we send whoever is best informed to do that." The investigations looking at Facebook are focused on areas advertising, manipulation, consent and safety. Facebook has a top expert for each of those areas. But Mark Zuckerberg, it's entirely reasonable to say, isn't one of them. Sorry? When his initial statement was posted, those who read it noticed something immediately: he didn't say sorry. Later, in follow up interviews - he appeared to offer something of an apology. "So this was a major breach of trust and I'm really sorry that this happened," he told CNN, and repeated in similar words to Wired magazine, tech publication Recode and the New York Times, all of which were given interviews on Wednesday. And he is "sorry" - sorry that the company's missteps and naivety (his word) led to $50bn being wiped off the company's value and reputational damage from which it may never fully recover. His words today expressed an apology for the result, not the cause. Remember, it's possible to feel sorry for one's self. Analytica comeback For me, the most surprising remark Mr Zuckerberg made today  was his answer to a question from the New York Times . "Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in?" asked the newspaper's reporter, Sheera Frenkel. "We’re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there’s no wrongdoing here," Mr Zuckerberg said. So, it's possible. Mr Zuckerberg's recent struggles as chief executive have been because of his inability to understand the root of the public's anger. First on fake news, and now this. Some people think that the public is less concerned about the specific nuances of whether or not a policy was breached, and more about the broad ethical stance of Facebook on the use of its data to achieve the aims that Cambridge Analytica promises its clients.

They showed either a chief executive getting on top of the situation, and making what sounded like significant concessions in areas we wouldn’t expect. Or, it was a skilled, composed display of PR spin – a media appearance for which he had almost six days to prepare. Speaking to CNN’s Laurie Segall, Mr Zuckerberg made it look like he was giving up a lot, while simultaneously dodging the big issues. Yes, he said he welcomed more regulation – but in a way that wouldn’t have that much impact on Facebook’s business at all. Yes, he said he would be “happy” to testify before Congress and other committees around the world – but immediately gave himself the get-out clause he has used to avoid all of the other hearings so far. Yes, he did say sorry – but only for the situation, not specifically for the actions of his company. Simply – Mr Zuckerberg did enough to buy some time as he tries to get his company in order, but not much more than that. His comment – “I actually am not sure we shouldn’t be regulated” – seemed like a major admission that the time may have come for stricter rules on his business. In reality, he was advocating for a bill that would arguably have more impact on the people who advertise on Facebook than Facebook itself.   “I think there are things like ads transparency regulation that I would love to see,” he told CNN. He was referring to the Honest Ads Act that’s being debated by US politicians right now, a proposed law that would force buyers of any online advertising relating to candidates in an election campaign to be more transparent about funding. In other words, the internet equivalent of messages like “I’m Donald Trump and I support this message” being tacked to TV spots. The Honest Ads Act would also require companies like Facebook to take “reasonable” steps to determine that no foreign power was buying ads. Here’s what’s worth knowing: following the fall-out over Russian-bought ads in the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook said it created the tools needed to handle political ad spending better. So if the Honest Ads Act was passed today, chances are Facebook would already be in compliance. Dodged hearings In the days following the Cambridge Analytica revelations, several investigatory committees in the US and Europe said they would be calling on Mr Zuckerberg to testify in person. “The short answer is I’m happy to,” he told CNN. “If it’s the right thing to do.” This has been Mr Zuckerberg’s position all along. In the past, he’s sent people like lawyer Colin Stretch, who took the lion’s share of questions when the social media companies were summoned to Washington late last year.   When it wasn’t lawyers, the company opted to send specific department heads, such as policy boss Monika Bickert. But to be fair to Facebook, this is a valid approach. If Mr Zuckerberg is a good boss capable of delegating effectively, his department heads would certainly know more about their respective areas than he would. It’s worth remembering that when it comes to political theatre, those calling Mr Zuckerberg to Washington would enjoy very much the chance to look tough and impressive when dealing with a powerful tech leader. “That’s not a media opportunity – or at least it’s not supposed to be,” Mr Zuckerberg told CNN. “We just want to make sure we send whoever is best informed to do that.” The investigations looking at Facebook are focused on areas advertising, manipulation, consent and safety. Facebook has a top expert for each of those areas. But Mark Zuckerberg, it’s entirely reasonable to say, isn’t one of them. Sorry? When his initial statement was posted, those who read it noticed something immediately: he didn’t say sorry. Later, in follow up interviews – he appeared to offer something of an apology. “So this was a major breach of trust and I’m really sorry that this happened,” he told CNN, and repeated in similar words to Wired magazine, tech publication Recode and the New York Times, all of which were given interviews on Wednesday.   And he is “sorry” – sorry that the company’s missteps and naivety (his word) led to $50bn being wiped off the company’s value and reputational damage from which it may never fully recover. His words today expressed an apology for the result, not the cause. Remember, it’s possible to feel sorry for one’s self. Analytica comeback For me, the most surprising remark Mr Zuckerberg made today  was his answer to a question from the New York Times . “Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in?” asked the newspaper’s reporter, Sheera Frenkel. “We’re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there’s no wrongdoing here,” Mr Zuckerberg said. So, it’s possible. Mr Zuckerberg’s recent struggles as chief executive have been because of his inability to understand the root of the public’s anger. First on fake news, and now this. Some people think that the public is less concerned about the specific nuances of whether or not a policy was breached, and more about the broad ethical stance of Facebook on the use of its data to achieve the aims that Cambridge Analytica promises its clients. Mr Zuckerberg had the chance to say such activity was no longer welcome on his network, but chose not to take it.

(Courtesy)  news Opposition Chief Raila Odinga on Wednesday through Thursday morning was under fire after posting a photo in which he was having a handshake with US ambassador to Kenya, Robert Godec. In a post across his social media channels, Mr Odinga revealed that the US ambassador had visited him in his Capitol Hill offices in Nairobi. “We discussed the national reconciliation initiative and how there can be no progress without justice. The US has pledged to support us as we proceed with the task of righting the wrongs that have ailed us for far too long,” Mr Odinga posted. ALSO READ: ODM finally speaks of joining DP Ruto&apos;s camp for 2022 Hundreds of Kenyans who follow the Opposition Chief criticised the meeting between the two, faulting Mr Odinga of playing double standards, while others praised his resilience in reconciliation with the US, even after Godec castigated the swearing-in ceremony of January 30. — Raila Odinga (@) 2013-07-22 14:22:09.0   One Hussler Sonko on Facebook told off Mr Odinga that he once said the US could not be trusted, and wondered why the former Premier had turned against his own vows. “I mean former baba you told us that the US cannot be trusted and should keep off Kenyan affairs,, I just asking did this US change from America one to United Siaya?” Hussler posed to Mr Odinga. Another follower, Roy Ombija, added that Mr Odinga’s acts portrayed a high level of hypocrisy. “This is the apex of hypocrisy...As a staunch supporter, I never ever in my wildest of dreams imagined saying this against Raila Amolo Odinga. “At this rate you’re watering down your legacy in gushes Sir...me wonders who is next in line on your appointments - Chebukati and Chiloba? My allegiance is leaning more towards Miguna Miguna by every passing day,” Ombija said. Kenyans react to Raila's photo with Godec. (Courtesy)   Thomas Isoka Chebai wrote: “Next you should meet Chebukati and Chiloba, Cambridge Analytica, Morpho yes just keep on meeting all of them I&apos;m currently battling depression courtesy to your silly political maneuvers punctuated by yourself interests. You have christened yourself Joshua I hear by christen you as new day &apos;Okwonkwo&apos;. Your inability to grab power sulks.” Supporters Equally, his staunch supporters praised his latest move to have talks with the US representative, nearly two weeks after meeting his political emissaries President Uhuru Kenyatta. Denis Owino Wuod Awasi wrote to Mr Odinga; “Congratulations Raila Amolo Odinga, the handshake has brought more good than harm, but you have taken too long to recognise Uhuru Kenyatta as a legitimate President of Kenya. You would have done after 26th repeat Presidential Election and you would have saved more lives.” Kenyans react to Raila's photo with Godec. (Courtesy) Another follower, Apostle Sam Onduru said: “For the first time I support you; you are brilliant here than on the streets. Kindly agree with PR Kenyatta well so that the two of you mend the walls your fathers broken in this nation for reasons only known to then in the graves. may their souls rest in peace.” He added: “The problem of Kenya is honestly your families, just the Odinga and Kenyatta family. I think you won&apos;t arrest me for this because you also all the times tells people hard facts.” — BRAVIN #emo##emo# (@) 2013-07-22 14:22:09.0    Tweet  Subscribe to the Pulselive Newsletter!

Here’s how to find out   Vignesh Ananthraj   Follow @@vignesh_a2  Share @Whatsapp Share @Facebook Share @twitter Share @Email Share @google+ Share @reddit  Representational image We all know that Facebook has access to more personal data than our spouses, friends or parents may ever know. The recent scandal involving Facebook and political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which has allegedly illegally harvested data from over 50 million Facebook users in 2014 and used this to influence elections in several countries, has raised the important question – how safe is my personal data on Facebook? Most Indian users may have found the data breach irrelevant to their own lives, but what if you could access all of the data that Facebook has collected about you over the years? What if you could know the names of all the advertisers that may have access to your personal data, thanks to Facebook? Although Facebook does allow a user to access the names of the advertisers, the worrisome fact is that the Social Networking giant does not clearly mention what specific data of the person is being shared with the advertisers. Despite numerous requests by activists and organisations, the company’s response has been evasive. In an email sent on April 6, 2017, Facebook responds to the question “Which contact info does each advertiser have? (which email, which phone number, etc), posed by an activist. The social media giant states, “Advertisers do not give Facebook any users' contact details. We only get such details in hashed form and they are, in any event, deleted within 48 hours. We are therefore not able to confirm what contact information an advertiser has for a particular user.”   In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data breach, we tell you how to access the names of all the advertisers, who have access to your data - most probably without your knowledge.  So how exactly can a user obtain the list of advertisers to whom Facebook has allegedly given access to your data? It is a simple process. - Go to your Facebook profile, then click on the down arrow next to the Quick Help icon on the top right hand corner of the page - In the drop-down menu, click on Settings. - Then click on ‘Download a copy of your Facebook data’ After a few minutes, Facebook will send a link to your email with all of the data in a zip file that Facebook has stored ever since you began using the site. Depending on how much of a social media user you are, the file size can vary. In the HTML folder of the zip file, you can access all of the advertisers that Facebook has possibly given your data to by clicking on the page titled ‘ads’. The names are strategically hidden at the end of the page under the title ‘Advertisers with your contact info’. Here’s a screenshot of the advertisers to whom my personal data has in all likelihood been given to. The same HTML file begins with ‘Ads Topics’ – which are essentially the keywords that are used to cater ads to your Facebook page. Or in Facebook’s words, “A list of topics that you may be targeted against based on your stated likes, interests and other data you put in your Timeline.” The next header is ‘Ads History’ – which is basically every single ad that you have ever clicked on. However, the ads page is just the tip of the iceberg. There is an extensive list of details of every login session, along with the IP addresses. Ever wondered why the Facebook app always forces you to download its messenger, although it can access the messages perfectly through a mobile browser? Now go back to your HTML folder and click on contact_info. This will give you scores of names, contact numbers and emails of family members, friends or stranger you may have contacted via email or saved on your mobile phone. In my case, while I had deleted Facebook Messenger from my mobile phone a few months ago, Facebook still has a large chunk of my phone book, with names and contact details. Apart from your contacts, ad information, login sessions, here are the other details that Facebook possesses about you. -Every single messaging thread, even the ones you have deleted and from the people you have blocked. - Every public event you have either declined or accepted - Every single like, new friend made, post commented on and pages followed, down to the minute you accessed the same. - A list of people whom you unfriended, blocked, along with a list of friends you rejected and accepted, down to the date at which you became friends. - Every poke ever exchanged, given or received. -low res files of every photo, video ever posted. Here’s a full list of what information about you is available to Facebook. Along with a host of other information. With Facebook knowing so much about our personal lives, the real question to ask is, are you ok with a social media organisation having so much data about you? Are you comfortable with non-specified information being shared with advertisers? An even worrisome prospect to think about after the Cambridge Analytica incident is - what would you stand to lose if some of this information about you is to fall into the wrong hands?   Also Read :  Explainer: The Cambridge Analytica scandal, and how your FB data may have been used  /.block

The EU are talking about levying a tax on digital revenue as a way of clamping down on tech giants paying a relatively small amount of tax in Europe. This has added to the jitters surrounding the possibility of a trade war. The French division at Kingfisher continues to be one of the worst performers at the group, and a stock availability issue weighed on the firm’s figures. The Screwfix business in the UK and the Polish division are in rude health. Revenue rose by 3.8%, but profit slipped by 10%, and the company stated that the business climate was mixed. The less-than-optimistic forecast, combined with continuing French issues, dented investor sentiment. If the stock remains below the 200-day moving average at 319p, it could target 298p. Softcat shares have been hit by a bout of profit-taking. The company revealed respectable figures, but investors decided to take some cash off the table. Revenue for the first-half increased by 24.8% and gross profit rose by 22%, while the interim dividend was boosted by 3.3%. In January and February a number of investment banks upped their ratings for Softcat, so it would seem that brokers had high hopes for the stock. The share price has been in an upward trend since late 2016 and today’s move lower may entice new buyers. US Indices are mixed today as investors remain cautious over the possibility of a trade war. The EU are contemplating imposing a 3% tax on various online services, and this has added weight to the argument we are heading for a trade war. It is possible we could see pressure put on tech giants such as Alphabet, Google’s owner. Facebook is still in the news for all the wrong reasons, as the scandal in relation to Cambridge Analytica has tainted the company’s image. The stock lost ground in early trading, but has now turned positive. At 6pm (UK time) the Federal Reserve is widely tipped to raise interest rates to 1.75% from 1.5%. A growing number of traders are now talking about the possibility of four rate hikes this year. Jerome Powell took over the Fed chair in February, and he is likely to pick up where Janet Yellen left off in terms of language and tone. US total homes sales in February jumped to 5.54 million, up from 5.38 million, with economists expecting a reading of 5.4 million. FX GBP/USD has pushed higher on the back of solid unemployment and wages data from the UK. The jobless rate in the UK fell to 4.3% - its joint-lowest since records began, and monthly earnings ticked up by 2.6%. With British inflation sliding and earnings rising, things are looking up for consumers in the UK. Sterling has been climbing versus the US dollar since the start of the month, and if 1.4088 is cleared it could target 1.4150. EUR/USD is gaining ground on the back of the weaker greenback. There were no major economic updates from the eurozone today, but traders will be keeping an eye on this evening’s Fed meeting. Dealers are treating an interest-rate hike of 0.25% as a done deal, but the press conference that follows might give us an idea what the US central bank will do throughout the year.   Commodities Gold has been lifted by the softer US dollar, but traders may not be overly long going into the Fed meeting this evening. The press conference could lay the foundations for four rate hikes this year. Lately the inverse relationship between the US dollar and gold has been strong, and given we have an update from the Fed in a few hours, it is likely to remain strong.  WTI and Brent Crude oil were jolted higher on the back of the energy information agency inventory data. The report showed that US oil inventories fell by 2.62 million barrels, while traders were expecting a build of 3.05 million barrels. Gasoline inventories fell by 1.69 million barrels, and dealers were expecting a drop of 2.4 million barrels. CMC Markets is an execution-only service provider.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam questioned Facebook in Parliament on Thursday (22 March) on why the social media giant had not been open when it first found out about a massive breach of its user data arising from the Cambridge Analytica (CA) saga. Shanmugam’s pointed questions directed at Simon Milner, Facebook’s vice-president of public policy for Asia-Pacific, during the hearing for the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods come after media reports in the past week revealed that  In 2014, CA hired a researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, to gather basic profile information of Facebook users along with what they chose to “Like.” Some 270,000 Facebook users downloaded Kogan’s app and the researcher was able to collect data of 50 million people. Kogan later passed the information without Facebook’s knowledge to CA, which then used it to reach voters with hyper-targeted messaging and advertising based on their psychological profiles. Pointing out that the saga constituted a major breach of Facebook’s policy, which the company discovered in 2015, Shanmugam said, “You do not inform the users (then), which is very odd, and inexplicable and one would say, inexcusable. You do not tell the public about it. And it’s contrary to everything you have stated about the importance of protecting data, and protecting users’ data. “We then fast forward through last year, nothing. This year, UK parliament, questions were asked. From my perspective, those questions were capable of being answered only in one way, which is to come out with the truth. And that didn’t happen,” said Shanmugam, referring to Milner’s answers to a UK select committee on fake news on 8 February this year. Denying any wrongdoing and dishonesty in answering to the UK committee, Milner said that “in hindsight” he could have given a fuller answer but could not do so given the context of the hearing then. “I felt that at the time I was giving truthful answers to questions. Now in hindsight, especially given recent events, I wish I had said more but at that time…it is really only the events of the last few days and the things that have come to light,” said Milner. During the sometimes fiery exchange,  Milner insisted that he was being open in his answers to Shanmugam and the Select Committee and questioned the minister on the relevance of his questions concerning developments outside of Singapore. This prompted a strong response from Shanmugam who said the questions on exchanges between Facebook and other jurisdictions were very relevant to Singapore in establishing the degree of trust the government could place in Facebook. “Facebook can be trusted to answer questions when asked, Facebook can be trusted to be a reliable partner, that the government of Singapore can depend on Facebook to tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. “If you thought that you could turn up here today, not answer questions on CA, and explain (away) your answers today with your answers five weeks ago to a different parliament. We are all sovereign parliaments but we look at your conduct all over the world,” Shanmugam said.     react-empty: 2 What to read next AFP News Yahoo News Singapore AFP News WOWtv react-empty: 70 AFP News Associated Press WOWtv Associated Press Yahoo News Singapore AFP News Associated Press WOWtv Malay Mail The Guardian Yahoo News Singapore AFP News WOWtv Reuters South China Morning Post Digital Spy AFP News WOWtv EdgeProp Yahoo News Singapore react-empty: 62 react-empty: 65 react-empty: 66 bf1-sdarlaws-005.adx.bf1.yahoo.com Sat Jun 2 04:00:30 UTC 2018

A detailed, article in Motherboard magazine explained how the whizkids of CA were, perhaps single-handedly, responsible for putting US President Donald Trump in power, and persuading the people of Great Britain to leave the EU. What was astonishing was how CA harvested Facebook and other social media and created individual demographic and psychographic profiles of tens of millions of voters in the US. It then individually targeted people with messages on who to vote for, who not to, when to go out and vote, and, in certain cases, not to do so. I set out to find out how this could possibly happen, and if there were other Cambridge Analyticas in the wild, which we could use for our businesses. I found two things: What CA did was painstakingly done over many years, mostly through Facebook, which was borderline illegal; and that there were other firms out there, who could not do a CA on you, but come pretty close. Well, Cambridge Analytica is in the news again, and how! And, it has also dragged in a much larger beast into the spotlight: Facebook. Facebook has been in the spotlight before. Many times, it has been there for the wrong reasons – privacy, security, free basics, payments, non-compliance of regulation. However, the current situation is perhaps its most dire yet, and I believe that it is the end of Facebook as we know it. The company will have to relook its technology, security and privacy policies as a whole. Beyond that, it will have to reconsider its core business model, and also its whole set of beliefs and values, the way Uber is doing. Talking of Uber, when the Travis Kalanick controversy, and subsequent sacking, broke upon us, I had spoken about how perhaps Travis should be replaced by a Blockchain! Again, I want to explore and suggest as to how perhaps Blockchain can be the answer to Facebook’s problems, and even be its disruptor. Let us understand the Blockchain first: it is a distributed database shared among a network of computers, all of which must approve a transaction before it can be recorded. So, it is essentially a universal ledger in the cloud, of digital records (or identity)—one that’s shared between various parties. It can only be updated by consensus of a majority of the participants. So, it is a pure peer-to-peer network, which can be used to exchange digital assets without friction (no central ledger and transactions between people can happen nearly instantly without any intermediary), execute smart contracts (contracts and documents can be stored electronically, and executed algorithmically), and store digital records (have an electronic identity). Above all, the Blockchain is the ultimate decentraliser . This bit was actually supposed to be the Internet’s responsibility. The Internet, in fact, did solve a multitude of problems for us: it solved the information, distribution and communication problems with search, ecommerce and email/chat. However, there were two other problems it was supposed to address: trust and intermediation. The Internet was supposed to be the ultimate disintermediator – create a level playing field, help the long tail, and destroy monopolies. This has not happened; arguably, the Internet created bigger monopolies and intermediaries than ever. Google monopolises information, Amazon monopolises online shopping, and Facebook monopolises connections, communication and interactions. On the Internet, if it is free, then you are the product. Therefore, Facebook’s powerful business model is all about monetising you , and your data. It serves to collect every single piece of information, emotion, intention, location and connection you have, make sense out of it for an advertiser, and sell this packaged and massaged information to them. Facebook has vast repositories of this data – the new oil – in its server farms: data from its eponymous two billion strong social network, from Instagram, and now from Whatsapp. It is estimated that more than 90 percent of all the trillions of pictures out there are hosted by Facebook or one of its companies! Around 70 percent of Facebook is now accessed on the mobile phone, so its already rich data is further enhanced by location, proximity, and your phone connections (on WhatsApp). Facebook has powerful incentives to collect and store as much data as it can so that its formidable machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms crunch this to create devastatingly accurate profiles of you. Machine learning algorithms are an insatiable beast, and the more data they ingest, the more powerful they become. The more the data, the sharper your profile, the more specifically targeted the advertising, the more the advertisers pay for it. This business model is a self-propelling machine, a fission reactor of data. Except that now, the fissile material has reached critical mass, and, Frankenstein-like, has the potential to explode in the face of its creators. What if there was a different business model, and what if it was decentralised? Imagine if the architecture of the social network was on a Blockchain, and each user was a node on the same. The user would specify what data could be shared or not, and if it were to be so, it would be by some kind of consensus, rather than being decided by one single centralized monopoly. Based on the data the user shared with the advertiser, the advertiser would directly pay the user through a set of self-actuating smart contracts. And, the payment would be through some manner of cryptocurrency tokens or coins. These coins, in turn, could be used to buy user data, or exchanged for goods and services. They can also be freely listed and traded on a crypto exchange, and be redeemed for other cryptocurrency or fiat currency. This would be a win-win for the user and the advertiser: the user would get paid for sharing her data and would control the extent of data shared, and the advertiser would still pay, but to a bunch of its customers, rather than one monolithic identity. There is then the obvious advantage of security. Given the distributed, consensus-driven nature of Blockchain, an external agency like CA cannot just harvest data without explicit permission, and distributed consensus. This was the loophole that CA employed in the current architecture. The above is not my original idea, and is not wholly fiction. There are Social 3.0 networks mushrooming, networks that do not ‘sell’ you, and involve direct payments between producers and consumers. Steemit ( www.steemit.com ) is one such example: It is a Blockchain based platform, where you get paid for good content; users post and upvote articles on Steemit to get your share of the daily rewards pool. There are already competitors to Uber emerging, for example, where drivers and passengers directly fix rides and pay each other through smart contracts. This has started emerging in music and content too, where the musician directly sells her music to her customers, rather than through iTunes, and gets paid through Bitcoin or Ether or equivalent. All of these ideas are in their infancy, but these are the future. They are true Peer-to-Peer or P2P networks. Facebook is not P2P, it is P2F2P; neither is YouTube frankly, which is P2Y2P. The Blockchain, as previously stated, is potentially the great decentraliser. It is not surprising, therefore, that Mark Zuckerberg had already started exploring Blockchain and Crypto, and, in fact, made it his mission for this year. He knows, perhaps better than us, that Cambridge Analytica is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. He will have to lead Facebook’s charge into new business models, or a Blockchain-based competitor will come and disrupt him.

Wylie noted that Nix “didn’t have the authority to spend that much money without approval.” The company was embroiled in scandal after an undercover reporter filmed Nix pitching his company’s services to ensnare politicians and surreptitiously target voters using data that Cambridge Analytica scooped up from 50 million Facebook users.

"We are pausing our campaign on Facebook.

This heightened concerns over whether such data were used to try to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit vote. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologised Wednesday for the breach of trust and said Facebook would investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of data. ISBA will push Facebook for details on this investigation during its meeting Friday, Director General Phil Smith said in an email to CNBC. "We want to understand the scope of the inquiry Mark Zuckerberg announced yesterday. We want reassurances for our members that it will get to the bottom of the issues and any implications for the public and for advertisers." David Kershaw, chief executive of ad agency M&C Saatchi, said clients would begin to exert pressure on the social network.‎ "Make no mistake, Facebook is an amazing medium from the advertisers' point of view because of the accuracy of its targeting, which comes from data. But I think those large companies are now very nervous to be associated with a medium where the data is being abused, particularly in a political context," Kershaw told the BBC's Radio 4 "Today" programme on Thursday. Facebook takes a huge chunk of advertisers' budgets, booking US$39.9 billion in advertising revenue in 2017, according to financial filings, making it the second largest media owner in the world after Google.

Right in the middle of this: Cambridge Analytica. A British broadcaster, Channel 4, released a video showing Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix being filmed while talking about using sex workers to gain votes. The data analysis firm has been heavily under fire for possibly being involved in US President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, Facebook’s data leak and Malaysia’s 2013 polls. Alexander Nix, and the company he is CEO of, are infamous for using underhand tactics to manipulate people into voting a certain way. A generated by theme end A In the video, a Channel 4 reporter posed as an operative for a wealthy client hoping to get candidates elected in Sri Lanka. In a ploy to defame candidates and to deter people from voting for them, Alexander Nix suggested framing these candidates with sex workers, “Send some girls around to the candidate’s house, we have lots of history of things,” he said. “We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I’m saying”, Nix told Channel 4’s undercover reporter about his honey-traps. Ironically, when commenting on manipulating and blackmailing candidates, Nix also adds, “You know these sort of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption”. Cambridge Analytica is known for using online data to pinpoint target groups and design specific messages to cater to these groups, in a form of individualised advertising. In the video, Nix can be seen rather proudly advocating for his very questionable tactics, “Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true and make sure that that’s video recorded”.

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls (Reuters) - Cambridge Analytica, which is at the center of a controversy over harvested personal data about Facebook users, on Thursday released a timeline highlighting its relationship with Global Science Research (GSR) and whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Aleksandr Kogan, who runs GSR, designed a personality quiz that was taken by a few hundred thousand people but the app on which it ran also collected details about all of their Facebook 'friends' without their knowledge or consent. That data was then used in a targeted digital ad campaign in support of Donald Trump's successful run for the U.S. presidency, Cambridge Analytica's CEO Alexander Nix told an undercover reporter from Britain's Channel Four news. Cambridge Analytica's timeline also revealed contractual and legal agreements made in the name of its associated entity, SCL Elections. http://bit.ly/2G49xji August, 2013 Christopher Wylie begins part-time at SCL Elections. May, 2014 Starts a research project with GSR. July, 2014 Wylie stops working with company. Late 2014 Legal action against Wylie for breach of contract and potential intellectual property theft. August, 2015 Wylie signs legal document to say he holds no company material. December, 2015 - The Guardian reports GSR data was in breach of Facebook's terms of service, and potentially the Data Protection Act. - Facebook contacts companies to understand the data and asks to delete it. July, 2016 GSR seeks to verify company has deleted all of their data. August, 2016 Takes legal action against GSR for licensing illegally acquired data. November, 2016 Reaches a settlement with GSR. March, 2017 - Completes an internal audit to confirm all GSR data (including all derivatives and backups) have been deleted. Certifies to Facebook that company holds no data from GSR. - Britain's Information Commission (ICO) officials visit company's London office. September, 2017 ICO writes to Cambridge Analytica about processing data on U.S. nationals in the UK. October, 2017 ICO writes to Cambridge Analytica about alleged work on the Brexit campaign. 2018 - ICO requests access to company's systems, says a whistleblower informed company still holds GSR data. Reiterates company deleted all GSR data and certified it to Facebook; offers to share all information on interactions with GSR. - Facebook suspends Cambridge Analytica and SCL's accounts, pending further investigation.

The social media giant is now embroiled in a scandal that has caused it to lose more than $50 billion in market value. The scandal also caused #deleteFacebook to trend on Twitter, as more and more people are calling for others to quit the social media app for good. It is somewhat ironic that Mr. Acton, whose worth is now $5.5 billion, has joined the #deletefacebook bandwagon, since he benefited greatly from Facebook immense popularity. Earlier in 2018, Mr. Acton aided with the financing of Signal Foundation. The foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is connected to Signal, another application for messages, but which is an encrypted application. Privacy advocates such as Edward Snowden have expressed their preference for using Signal. It is time. #deletefacebook — Brian Acton (@brianacton) March 20, 2018   A generated by theme end A “As more and more of our lives happen online, data protection and privacy are critical. This isn’t just important for select people in select countries. It’s important for people from all walks of life in every part of the world. Everyone deserves to be protected,” wrote Mr. Acton on Signal’s blog, upon its launch last month. Mr. Acton is only the latest voice raised publicly against Facebook from those who once worked with the company. Included among dissenters is Sean Parker, the first president of Facebook, who talked about the social media app’s negative effects on society last November. Added to the list is the former mentor of Mark Zuckerberg, Roger McNamee, who was also one of Facebook’s earliest investors. Mr. McNamee called for a subpoena from Congress for social media heads, including Mr. Zuckerberg. Additionally, Sandy Parakilas, said that from 2011 to 2012, when he was the company’s operations manager, he called for higher levels of security for the data of users, which went unheeded by the senior executives of the company. Mr. Parakilas wrote about this in the Washington Post. Jan Koum, the co-founder of What’sApp, has kept his Facebook account, where he has posted in support of President Trump and Israel. Mr. Koum stayed on as CEO after Facebook bought What’sApp. After reports surfaced about how Cambridge Analytica, partly owned by former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, gained access to millions of users’ accounts, #deleteFacebook began to trend on Twitter. Cambridge Analytica had teamed up with a researcher who formulated a personality quiz app that was accessed by 270,000 Facebook users, but disclosed their data. This data was later used in the formulation of the social media plan for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Facebook’s involvement in the scandal is now under scrutiny in the US and the UK, and the Chief Operating Officer of Cambridge Analytica has been suspended. Additionally, the social media giant announced that they’ve obtained the services of a third-party company for a forensic audit of how the analytics firm used its data.

Background The story was first broken by an investigation by the Observer and Guardian(sister) newspapers in the UK when 28 year-old Christopher Wylie, the man whose idea it was to develop a ‘psychological warfare tool’ to influence voter trends, admitted that his former employer and Facebook were complicit in harvesting the Facebook profiles of 50 million unsuspecting users without their knowledge or consent. This was followed up with a documentary revelation by Channel 4 News where Alexander Nix, the CEO of the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica explains to a potential client the illegal and unethical means by which they would spread fake news, misinformation and ‘dirt’ on political enemies to get their client elected to office. The New York Times reported that the raw data was still available online, some of which the paper had seen. What does this mean? The data was allegedly obtained by CA with the help of Dr Aleksandr Kogan’s personality quiz wherein 3,20, 000 Facebook users who took the quiz unwittingly granted access to not just their profiles, but also 160(each) of their friends’. Basic profile details(age, gender, location, etc.) combined with Facebook activities such as liking, reacting, sharing, commenting, etc. became large data sets that, through algorithms, revealed psychological patterns of users. For example, if you are a fan of an actor or politician and like their Facebook page or frequently share their posts, you have added your tiny bit to the large data set. Hundreds of users of your demographic are then targeted with subtle messaging on the actor's politics, their political party, in the run up to elections. If their opponent wishes, then it can influence the minds of their followers by spreading fake news and misinformation about them by using the psychological profile they have built. This, in turn, was reportedly exploited by CA for politically motivated messaging through the spread of fake news, misinformation and ‘dirt’ on political opponents. The matter is now under investigation in the UK and the US , with Mark Zuckerberg being summoned for an explanation in London. The investigation hopes to answer: through what means CA obtained this data, the scale of the data’s subsequent usage, why didn’t Facebook clamp down on the theft of their users’ data and how/ why it turned a blind eye to the issue as far back as 2014. What can you do? Even as mudslinging on which Indian national party used the services of Ovleno Business Intelligence,(the Indian arm of CA’s parent company) continues, Facebook users can restrict third party apps and ‘apps others use’ on their accounts on the app settings page on Facebook. While basic profile data will still be available, perhaps forever, these steps will ensure that no quiz/ game/ external app hands over your data to third parties. If you still don’t feel safe, consider deleting the Facebook app on your phone or deleting your account altogether.  /.block

In a statement on his page on the social media platform, Zuckerberg stopped short of an apology, which came under criticism. However, in an exclusive interview to CNN, Zuckerberg apologized for the “breach of trust” and said that he was “sorry [that] this happened.” Speaking to CNN’s Laurie Segall, Zuckerberg about the Cambridge Analytica controversy, and the steps the social media giant would be taking to prevent such a massive data leak from here on.

That is something that – looking back on this – we regret not doing at the time. We got that wrong. We’re committed to getting that right going forward,” Zuckerberg said. Transparency to users and screening developers Zuckerberg announced that they were working on a tool which will allow users whose data might have been compromised to be aware of the same. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company will proactively reach out and notify "anyone whose data might have been affected" by the massive Cambridge Analytica data breach. https://t.co/iaYBGyUo3k pic.twitter.com/hsznnk6AxL 	— CNN (@CNN) March 22, 2018 When Laurie asked why Facebook did not tell users that they knew about the data mining and Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerberg said that they believed the certification the political advocacy company and Kogan gave them saying they did not have any data from Facebook. He narrates that in 2015, journalists from The Guardian reached out to Facebook saying that they had evidence that Alexander Kogan had sold this data to Cambridge Analytica. Zuckerberg said that this was against the social network’s policy, and that Kogan’s app was banned as a result. “Cambridge Analytica and Kogan and the other folks with whom data was shared - we asked for formal certification that they didn’t have the data from anyone in the Facebook community or that they deleted it. They provided that certification. So as far as we understood, there was no data at the time of that episode,” he explained. When asked why didn’t Facebook follow up to ensure that they had actually deleted and were not misusing the data, Zuckerberg admitted that he had put too much trust in the developers and the certification they provided. “We’re going to do a full investigation into every app that has this kind of data before we lock down the platform. We are not just going to take people’s word for it. If we see anything suspicious – like the were signs were there in this case – we’re going to do a full forensic audit,” Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg also suggested that the question was not whether Facebook should be regulated so much as how best to do it. "I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated," Zuckerberg said. "There are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see." Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tells CNN: "I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated... I actually think the question is more 'What is the right regulation?' rather than 'Yes or no, should it be regulated?'" https://t.co/KQPmPYj9eb pic.twitter.com/tuIjBKp3Qu 	— CNN (@CNN) March 22, 2018 ‘Ready to testify before Congress’ Zuckerberg said that he was ready to testify before US Congress if need be. Although Facebook employs a small army of lawyers and lobbyists in Washington, Zuckerberg himself has never testified before a congressional committee. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he is "happy to" testify before Congress "if it's the right thing to do" https://t.co/QLmFe43vp2 pic.twitter.com/yiAfixLwBg 	— CNN (@CNN) March 22, 2018 Politicians have called for Zuckerberg to testify before their legislative bodies in the five days since the Cambridge Analytica scandal erupted. "The short answer is I'm happy to if it's the right thing to do," Zuckerberg said. “What we try to do is send the person at Facebook who will have the most knowledge. If that's me, then I am happy to go," he reiterated. He also got particularly sentimental when asked about his daughters and how that had changed his outlook. “Having kids changes a lot,” he began, “I used to think the most important thing to me by far was to have the greatest positive impact on the world that I can. And now, I really just care about building something that my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for. That’s what is my guiding philosophy at this point.” "I really just care about building something that my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for. That's what is kind of my guiding philosophy at this point."

The meeting would discuss various means to ensure that forces that subvert the electoral process are not successful. There is a need to ensure that the election process is not affected by manipulation on the social media, ECI officials said. Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are at the centre of a controversy over allegations of harvesting and use of personal data of 50 million people on the social media platform to try and influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit vote in the UK. The ECI would also study the allegations made by the BJP that the Congress party's campaign in the recently held Gujarat elections was managed by CA. The BJP claims the Congress has also engaged or is in the process of engaging CA for the 2019 polls, and that it used the firm in the Gujarat assembly elections last year. The Congress, however, countered this claim and said that it was the BJP which had used CA in the past. It said that the BJP had used CA in the Bihar 2010 elections.

India will hold several key state polls this year ahead of general elections in 2019. Zuckerberg also apologised to users for allowing political-advertising firm Cambridge Analytica to gain access to the personal data of 50 million Facebook members without their knowledge. Meanwhile, the Election Commission of India is said to have begun examining the facts that have come to light in the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica case to determine whether it needs to investigate if there was any interference in the electoral process. Union minister for electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad has alleged that the firm had an association with the Congress party and that it was possibly used for the Gujarat elections. Congress has denied the accusation, saying in turn that it was the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that had links with the firm through JDU leader KC Tyagi’s son Amrish Tyagi, who represented the firm in India. BJP is in coalition with JDU in Bihar. Tyagi said on Thursday that his son hadn’t got any help from Cambridge Analytica. Congress said the firm wasn’t hired by the party or its chief Rahul Gandhi, who said the government was using the controversy as a diversionary tactic. The government was ready to launch an enquiry to see if Facebook had any role to play in unfairly influencing elections in the country and if required will summon Zuckerberg for an explanation, Prasad told ET in an interview on Wednesday. He warned social media companies of stringent actions if there was any attempt to influence the electoral process. Micro-voter targeting, the main service provided by Cambridge Analytica, was not used by the BJP in the 2014 general election. But some other services, offered by Indian affiliate Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI), were used by it in two state assembly elections later that year, senior party sources told ET. “I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Zuckerberg wrote in the 940-word post on his Facebook profile page. “I promise you we’ll work through this and build a better service over the long term.” He said key steps had been taken in 2014 to prevent “bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way.” He then outlined the measures that the social media giant will adopt. “We will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity,” he said. “We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit… We’re going to review thousands of apps.” Developers that have misused personally identifiable information will be banned and those affected will be informed. “That includes people whose data Kogan misused here as well,” he said, referring to researcher Aleksandr Kogan who passed on the 50 million users’ data that he’d obtained to Cambridge Analytica. Developers’ data access will be restricted even further to prevent other kinds of abuse. “For example, we will remove developers’ access to your data if you haven’t used their app in three months. We will reduce the data you give an app when you sign in — to only your name, profile photo, and email address,” he said. “We’ll require developers to not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data.” Further changes will be made in the next few days, he said. Facebook will soon allow users to see the apps being used and an easier option to revoke their access to data. “We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it,” he said. The scandal erupted after a whistleblower revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to Trump’s 2016 campaign, accessed personal data from 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge, and might have kept the information even after being told to delete it. Cambridge Analytica created psychological profiles on the 50 million Facebook users via a personality prediction app created by Kogan. Zuckerberg said he wanted to increase data protection at Facebook by hiring more people and not just deploying artificial intelligence. AI can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at,” he told the NYT. “So we’re going to double the amount of people working on security this year. We’ll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now.” In his Facebook post, Zuckerberg said the company had made mistakes. “I started Facebook, and at the end of the day, I’m responsible for what happens on our platform. I’m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community,” he said. Zuckerberg said Facebook has a “responsibility” to protect its users’ data and if it fails, “we don't deserve to serve you”. Zuckerberg said Facebook plans to alert everyone whose data was accessed by Cambridge Analytica. But he added that the company shouldn’t have not waited this long to tell people what happened. “That’s definitely something that, looking back on this, I regret that we didn’t do at the time,” he told CNN. “I think we got that wrong… I started this when I was so young and inexperienced. I made technical errors and business errors. I hired the wrong people. I trusted the wrong people.” Over the past few days, Facebook has been faced with an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and calls for legislative testimony in the US and Europe.

NEW DELHI: India’s key ministers advocated a robust data privacy regime in the country that ensures the safety and security of personal information of its billion-plus population while enabling unhindered innovation and technological growth. Data security and privacy are top priority for the government, which is already following global best practices, telecom minister Manoj Sinha said at the second Economic Times India Mobile Conclave here on Thursday. “Data security and privacy will be a key facet of the upcoming National Telecom Policy 2018 and I’m certain that the legal framework being formulated by the Justice Srikrishna Committee will fully secure the country’s data,” the minister said. The BN Srikrishna Committee is preparing the crucial legislation and framing data protection rules and started the public consultation process in January. It is likely to submit the draft of the law soon. All companies are welcome to operate in India, but they should not compromise the data of Indians, minister for electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad said. “We want India to become a big hub of data analysis. Therefore, we need to have a balance between data safety and security and innovation,” he said. On Wednesday, Prasad had warned Facebook that misuse of data of Indians to influence the electoral process would not be tolerated. He reiterated that he is “not taking on” Facebook and that he is proud that 250 million Indians are part of the world’s biggest social network, which is a sign of empowerment. “Facebook is most welcome in India and I am happy that they are reinforcing their architecture, but companies like Cambridge (Analytica) have no place because they have publicly claimed that they misused the system to influence the voters,” Prasad said. Facebook came under fire after the revelation that British data firm Cambridge Analytica illegally collected the data of 50 million people and allegedly influenced voting, including the 2016 US Presidential election . Founder Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to work towards addressing privacy concerns. Issues such as data ownership, privacy and security are extremely important, said RS Sharma, chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. He said there are devices, pipes, operating systems and other players that collect a huge amount of data in the telecom sector and Trai has issued a consultation paper on how data can be regulated. “I agree the problem is urgent. The problem is also difficult because thus far we have not dealt with these kinds of problems,” Sharma said. Telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan said the policy will also look into data sovereignty, where individuals have choice and control over their security and the same goes for enterprises. “The data protection legislation under the Srikrishna committee is work in progress, which will indicate the principles to be kept in mind that will ensure that data protection of the individual is assured.” data could not found Comments 			 Read more on Also Read Nestle India to launch breakfast cereals in India EEPC India suggests ways to make India's export more competitive India to be growth engine of AMENA region: PepsiCo India CEO India waits in the closet India pitches for sugar export to China /articleshow_relatedtopic.cms?query=India&excludeid;=63423263potime:124 Comments Add Your Comments Commenting feature is disabled in your country/region. /insert_native_content.cms?contentID='210766~63423263~0'&removens;=1potime:2 Top Trending Terms 							 Lok Sabha 2019 Polls Kairna Bypolls Bypoll Results RR Nagar Bypoll Election Results Narendra Modi HD Kumaraswamy Karnataka Election How to Save Income Tax Amit Shah Rahul Gandhi BJP Congress /seowidget.cms?msid=60936787potime:1 Most Read Most Shared Most Commented India's purchase of Russian S-400 to curb military cooperation: US View: Judging by first, does Narendra Modi deserve second term?

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint New Delhi: The government is planning to come up with a long-term strategy to secure data on Indians, especially those using social media. Information and technology and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday met top officials of the IT ministry to discuss the plan, said a person aware of the development. The move comes after information on more than 50 million Facebook users were allegedly accessed without their consent by London-based analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica. The firm is accused of harvesting private data from millions of Facebook profiles to influence and identify voter behaviour in the US elections. A draft data protection framework is expected to be released by the IT ministry in a couple of months which will address issues such as collection of personal data, consent of consumers, penalties and compensation, code of conduct and an enforcement model. On Wednesday, Prasad, who is also a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson, had accused the Congress party of indulging in “theft of online data” to help with its election campaigns. He had also warned Facebook of stringent legal action if it was found misusing data on Indians. Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI), the Indian affiliate of Cambridge Analytica on Thursday denied use of any data collected from the public without their consent for any of its political analysis. “We are equally shocked and surprised to see the data breach controversy and we are also looking to end our association with them,” Himanshu Sharma, vice-president of OBI said, according to a report from ANI . The firm also denied having worked with Cambridge Analytica on any project related to social media. As the war of words continued between the BJP and the Congress party, the issue escalated on Thursday with both the parties accusing each other. Congress president Rahul Gandhi attacked the BJP-led Union government in a tweet saying that the party has “invented story on Congress and data theft” to deflect attention from the controversy over 39 Indians dying in captivity in Iraq. Prasad hit out at Gandhi accusing him of doing politics over dead bodies. Both parties have said they have not used the services of Cambridge Analytica. Anuja contributed to this story.

Lawmakers in the United States and the EU have called for probes into how Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to access data on 50 million users and use it to help the election campaign of President Donald Trump. Facebook shares have fallen 8.5 percent this week as investors fear the incident will lead to new regulation. 	The scrutiny and the risk of regulatory action could affect Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google, Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ), Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Microsoft Corp’s ( MSFT.O ) LinkedIn and the many others that make their user data available to outside developers. 	The interconnections between platforms such as Facebook and Google and third-party services sit at the core of the contemporary internet, enabling people to quickly share articles to Facebook from news websites and log into shopping apps using their Google account. 	But the Facebook case has turned the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that enable such data sharing, into a new front in the escalating battle between lawmakers and tech companies over the monitoring and securing of their vast platforms.

What character on “Downton Abbey” would you be? What breed of dog is best for you? Some enormous percentage of Facebook’s 2.13 billion users must have seen Facebook friends sharing results of various online quizzes. They are sometimes annoying, senseless and a total waste of time. But they are irresistible . Besides, you’re only sharing the results with your family and friends. There’s nothing more innocent, right? Wrong. Facebook is in the business of exploiting your data . The company is worth billions of dollars because it harvests your data and sells it to advertisers. Users are encouraged to like, share and comment their lives away in the name of staying connected to family and friends. However, as an ethical hacker, security researcher and data analyst , I know that there is a lot more to the story. The bedrock of modern democracy is at stake . Most people have heard of demographics – the term used by advertisers to slice up a market by age, gender, ethnicity and other variables to help them understand customers. In contrast, psychographics measure people’s personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. They help advertisers understand the way you act and who you are. Historically, psychographic data were much harder to collect and act on than demographics. Today, Facebook is the world’s largest treasure trove of this data. Every day billions of people give the company huge amounts of information about their lives and dreams. This isn’t a problem when the data are used ethically – like when a company shows you an ad for a pair of sunglasses you recently searched for. However, it matters a lot when the data are used maliciously – segmenting society into disconnected echo chambers, and custom-crafting misleading messages to manipulate individuals’ opinions and actions. That’s exactly what Facebook allowed to happen. Quizzes, reading your mind and predicting your politics Recent reports have revealed how Cambridge Analytica, a U.K.-based company owned by an enigmatic billionaire and led at the time by candidate Donald Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon, used psychographic data from Facebook to profile American voters in the months before the 2016 presidential election. Why? To target them with personalized political messages and influence their voting behavior . A whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie, described in detail how the company exploited Facebook users by harvesting their data and building models to “ target their inner demons .” How did Facebook let this happen? The company does more than just sell your data. Since the early 2000s, Facebook has provided access to academic researchers seeking to study you . Many psychologists and social scientists have made their careers analyzing ways to predict your personality and ideologies by asking simple questions. These questions, like the ones used in social media quizzes, do not appear to have obvious connections to politics. Even a decision like which web browser you are using to read this article is filled with clues about your personality . In 2015, Facebook gave permission to academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan to develop a quiz of his own . Like other quizzes, his was able to capture all of your public information , including name, profile picture, age, gender and birthday; everything you’ve ever posted on your timeline; your entire friends list; all of your photos and the photos you’re tagged in; education history; hometown and current city; everything you’ve ever liked; and information about the device you’re using including your web browser and preferred language. Kogan shared the data he collected with Cambridge Analytica, which was against Facebook policy – but apparently the company rarely enforced its rules . Going shopping for impressionable users Analyzing these data, Cambridge Analytica determined topics that would intrigue users, what kind of political messaging users were susceptible to, how to frame the messages, the content and tone that would motivate users, and how to get them to share it with others. It compiled a shopping list of traits that could be predicted about voters. Then the company was able to create websites, ads and blogs that would attract Facebook users and encourage them to spread the word. In Wylie’s words : “they see it … they click it … they go down the rabbit hole.” This is how American voters were targeted with fake news, misleading information and contradictory messages intended to influence how they voted – or if they voted at all . This is how Facebook users’ relationships with family and friends are being exploited for monetary profit, and for political gain . Knowingly putting users at risk Facebook could have done more to protect users. The company encouraged developers to build apps for its platform. In return, the apps had access to vast amounts of user data – supposedly subject to those rules that were rarely enforced . But Facebook collected 30 percent of payments made through the apps, so its business interest made it want more apps, doing more things. People who didn’t fill out quizzes were vulnerable, too. Facebook allowed companies like Cambridge Analytica to collect personal data of friends of quiz takers, without their knowledge or consent. Tens of millions of people’s data were harvested – and many more Facebook users could have been affected by other apps. Changing culture and politics In a video interview with the Observer, Wylie explained that “ Politics flows from culture … you have to change the people in order to change culture .” That’s exactly what Facebook enabled Cambridge Analytica to do. In 2017, the company’s CEO boasted publicly that it was “able to use data to identify … very large quantities of persuadable voters … that could be influenced to vote for the Trump campaign .” To exert that influence, Cambridge Analytica – which claims to have 5,000 data points on every American – used people’s data to psychologically nudge them to alter their behaviors in predictable ways . This included what became known as “fake news.” In an undercover investigation, Britain’s Channel 4 recorded Cambridge Analytica executives expressing their willingness to disseminate misinformation, with its CEO saying, “these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true, as long as they’re believed .” U.S. society was unprepared: 62 percent of American adults get news on social media , and many people who see fake news stories report that they believe them . So Cambridge Analytica’s tactics worked: 115 pro-Trump fake stories were shared on Facebook a total of 30 million times. In fact, the most popular fake news stories were more widely shared on Facebook than the most popular mainstream news stories . For this psychological warfare , the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica millions of dollars . A healthy dose of skepticism U.S. history is filled with stories of people sharing their thoughts in the public square. If interested, a passerby could come and listen, sharing in the experience of the narrative. By combining psychographic profiling, analysis of big data and ad micro-targeting , public discourse in the U.S. has entered a new era. What used to be a public exchange of information and democratic dialogue is now a customized whisper campaign: Groups both ethical and malicious can divide Americans, whispering into the ear of each and every user, nudging them based on their fears and encouraging them to whisper to others who share those fears. A Cambridge Analytica executive explained : “There are two fundamental human drivers … hopes and fears … and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that evoked that reaction from you. Our job is … to understand those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion.” The information that you shared on Facebook exposed your hopes and fears. That innocent-looking Facebook quiz isn’t so innocent. The problem isn’t that this psychographic data were exploited at a massive scale. It’s that platforms like Facebook enable people’s data to be used in ways that take power away from voters and give it to data-analyzing campaigners. In my view, this kills democracy. Even Facebook can see that, saying in January that at its worst, social media “ allows people to spread misinformation and corrode democracy .” My advice: Use Facebook with a healthy dose of skepticism.

In Britain and the United States, investigations are being held to find out whether Facebook did enough to protect its users’ private data. This came after a probe by Britain’s Channel 4 television exposed that a London-based political consultancy firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly accessed information on 50 million Facebook users to sway public opinion. Among its clients was Donald Trump during the campaign for the United States presidential election in 2016.   With Facebook being boxed into a corner, the case for regulation is gaining momentum, in view of allegations that social media platforms are responsible for communal tensions in Sri Lanka, ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, racism and terrorism in Europe and the distortion of democracy in the United States and elsewhere. Free speech advocates lambasted the Sri Lankan Government for blocking several social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp and Viber, early this month as part of measures to curtail the spread of anti-Muslim violence. But the Government felt the week-long ban together with the imposition of the State of Emergency was a necessary evil. It appears that the Government seeks to follow the golden mean by not implementing a total ban on social media but acting on the premise -- as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, despite his democracy-promoter credentials, says – that some regulation is required to obviate the negative effects of  social media. In a stricter sense, social media refer to social networking of groups or platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Instagram to share content in the form of texts, images and videos. In a loose sense, social media can mean any interactive website and even web-based games such as Candy Crush, Pokemon Go and the highly controversial and dangerous Blue Whale challenges. In a way limited regulation is warranted given the harm social media and internet pose to society at large. Social media breed social ills ranging from pornography and paedophelia to slavery, drug trade, racism and terrorism. With porn just a click away, children are exposed to adult material at the tender age of about 10, leading to the breakdown of society in the long run. A satanic world also exists within the World Wide Web, which was, paradoxically, hailed as the gateway to a knowledge-based society when it first made its presence felt.  Good and evil exist side by side.    What is scarier is that you are being watched.  Through your smart phones and even your smart television, information about you, your behaviour patterns and the websites you visit are harvested and relayed backed to device producers and marketers. The danger is more, if you are a social media user. Needless to say hackers have a field day. Our privacy has been seriously compromised.  The cyber world is huge. It has been called the largest unregulated and uncontrolled domain in human history. There has been little international effort to adopt global standards on cyberethics. On the contrary, cybersecurity has been discussed extensively by nations as nuclear systems and strategic databases are hacked in uncontrolled cyberwars. Cyberethics receive little attention, even as the digital world scrambles to embrace Artificial Intelligence which will make wars and conflicts more inhumane. The growing demand for techno-species such as sexbots indicates that even relationships are becoming inhumane.  Last month, addressing the Munich Security Conference, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres lamented over “the absence of consensus in the international community about how to regulate the so‑called Internet of things.”  But his remarks came largely in the context of cybersecurity instead of cyberethics. He said the multiplicity of activities — some by States, some by different actors, and even by amateurs — and the different uses that criminal organisations and terrorist organisations are making of the web create a level of threat that is becoming higher and higher and for which we have not yet found an adequate response. Last week, UN investigators slammed the social media giant Facebook as a “beast”, for being a carrier of hate speech that led to possible genocide of the Rohingya in Myanmar. When questioned about hate speech posts of Myanmar’s ultra-racist groups such as Ma Ba Tha and 969, Facebook said it suspended and sometimes removed anyone that “consistently shares content promoting hate.” “If a person consistently shares content promoting hate, we may take a range of actions such as temporarily suspending their ability to post and ultimately, removal of  their account.” But Facebook procedure is slow. Often, the harm is done before hate-speech posts are removed.  The so-called community standards Facebook is talking about in its defence are ineffective. This is evident in the rise of the far right in Europe. Facebook is the biggest culprit. Self-regulation by social media companies does not work, as the events in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and elsewhere show. Democracies and authoritarian states alike block social media. India regularly imposes internet blackouts whenever there are troubles in Kashmir. Pakistan bans social media during political unrests and when its requests for the removal of religiously sensitive material are ignored. In China, where Facebook remains blocked from 2009, the state decides on the access to social media.  Iran, North Korea, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Vietnam are among 18 nations that have blocked or temporarily restricted access to Facebook and other social media platforms to suppress political dissent or control protests. True, social media enable families and friends to stay in touch. To their credit, social media have played a big role in ending dictatorships, as happened in Egypt.  Governments cannot afford to block websites and social media, because e-commerce is a digital era reality. Also the cyber anarchists are one-step ahead of state authorities and regulations and keep devising various apps to circumvent blocks and bans. Given the vastness of the social media, regulating them is a terabyte task.  Yet, it will do a world of a good if companies such as Facebook and Twitter enhance self-regulation and make it effective. On Wednesday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg apologised for making mistakes that led to millions of Facebook users having their data exploited by Cambridge Analytica.  The same Zuckerberg had earlier dismissed as “pretty crazy idea” reports that claimed fake news on Facebook influenced the US presidential election in favour of Trump. Facebook’s role in alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election is being investigated by Special Investigator Robert Mueller.  The controversy has generated congressional moves to bring legislation to control political ads on social media. Instead of apologies, what is required is the adoption by social media companies of high ethical standards to combat hate-speech, racism, pornography, terrorism and political manipulation that distorts democracy. In this context, an international covenant on cyberethics is indeed in order.  We are not advocating an infringement of the freedom of expression. This freedom is, in any case, not absolute. We only underscore that freedom comes with responsibility.    Recommended Articles  Aloysius gave me Rs.100,000: SF Minister Field Marsh...

They were among 79 people asked to speak in parliament over the eight days set for the hearing. The wealthy city state is among the countries looking to introduce legislation, so far unspecified, to rein in fake news, a trend that has stirred concern that such laws could be used to exert government control over the media. "We do not believe that legislation is the best approach to addressing the issue," Alvin Tan, Facebook's head of public policy for Southeast Asia, said in a written submission. "Singapore already has a variety of existing laws and regulations which address hate speech, defamation and the spreading of false news." Singapore ranks 151 among 180 countries rated in the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders, a non-government group that promotes freedom of information. Lawmakers in the United States and Europe have called for probes into how Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to access data on 50 million users and use it to help the election campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump. Microblogging site Twitter also shared concerns about Singapore's plans. "No single company, governmental or non-governmental actor, should be the arbiter of truth," Kathleen Reen, Twitter's director of Public Policy for Asia Pacific, said. A parliamentary panel set up to consider possible measures, including legislation, drew 164 written responses from the public, a record for reactions to such a committee on any issue. Many of the examples of fake news, cited in a Singapore government paper on deliberate online falsehoods published in January, came from abroad. clear json client side share json client side share      if prioritizePictureRel is true, then this tag first searches image in the articles 'pictureRel' or similar relations, then searches summary teaser, then article teaser.

Saturday       Investors, lawmakers, advertisers pressure Facebook over data    - A + A WASHINGTON/LONDON (March 22): Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's apology for how his company handled 50 million users' data did little on Thursday to ease investor worries about the cost to fix mistakes and lawmakers' dismay that his response did not go far enough. Germany's second-largest bank Commerzbank AG has suspended advertising on Facebook until further notice, Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday, following in the steps of Mozilla, which runs the Firefox web browser. Allegations that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters and influence the 2016 presidential election has knocked more than US$50 billion of Facebook's market value this week. Five days after the scandal broke, Zuckerberg apologized on Wednesday that mistakes were made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to improve privacy protection. On Thursday, Facebook executives were still saying sorry. “It was a mistake”, Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships at Facebook, said at The Financial Times FT Future of News Conference in New York City. Zuckerberg's apology and promises were not enough to ease political pressure on the world's largest social media company. "It shouldn't be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data. Those rules should be set by society as a whole and so by parliament," British minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, told BBC Radio. "The big tech companies need to abide by the law and we're strengthening the law." In Washington, Zuckerberg's media rounds did little to satisfy lawmakers in either political party who have demanded this week that the billionaire testify before Congress. Facebook executives were expected to brief two congressional committees on Thursday, after being grilled for nearly two hours by staff for the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman and other executives were unable to answer many questions at Wednesday's meeting, according to two aides who were present. The executives said they had written down a list of 60 questions they promised to answer, the aides said. The Republican chairman and top Democrat of the US House Energy and Commerce Committee said they will in coming days formally ask Zuckerberg to testify. Reputational costs Wall Street analysts expressed relief that there were no signs so far of a more fundamental shift in the company's advertising-driven revenue model, but some said there would be costs to shore up its reputation. Facebook, with more than 2 billion monthly active users, made almost all its US$40.6 billion in revenue last year from advertising. Stifel analyst Scott Devitt cut his price target on Facebook by US$27 to US$168, while BofA Merrill Lynch slashed its target by US$35 to US$230. "Facebook's current plight reminds us of eBay in 2004 — an unstructured content business built on trust that lost that trust prior to implementing policies to add structure and process," Devitt said. "Warren Buffett has his own thing called a "too hard" pile, and we are choosing to put Facebook shares in it," he wrote. Facebook shares were down 2.2 percent on Thursday in heavy trading. Analysts said that Zuckerberg's promises to investigate thousands of apps, and to give members a tool that lets them turn off access, would not substantially reduce advertisers' ability to use Facebook data - the company's lifeblood. Nevertheless, open-source browser and app developer Mozilla said it was "pressing pause" on its Facebook advertising after the revelations prompted it to take a closer look at the site's default privacy settings. "We found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data – particularly with respect to settings for third party apps," Mozilla, it said in a blog post. "When Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, specifically strengthening its default privacy settings for third party apps, we’ll consider returning." Commerzbank said it, too, was pausing its campaign on Facebook. "Brand safety and data security are very important to us," head of brand strategy Uwe Hellmann told Handelsblatt. The comments were confirmed by a spokesman for the bank. The Times newspaper reported that British advertising group ISBA, which represents thousands of well-known brands, has threatened to withdraw ads if investigations show user data has been misused. "We think this issue is more likely to snowball than recede and that advertisers are reaching a tipping point at which spending on not only Facebook and other online platforms, is re-evaluated," brokerage Liberum said in a note. Technology stocks have fallen along with Facebook this week as investors worried about tighter scrutiny of global platforms like Google, Twitter and Snapchat. British police removed cordons around the London headquarters of Cambridge Analytica on Thursday after they deemed a suspicious package which sparked a security alert to be safe. Efforts by Britain's information watchdog to investigate Cambridge Analytica were delayed when a judge adjourned for 24 hours its application to search the company's head office.

Saturday       Cambridge Analytica London search warrant delayed by court    - A + A LONDON (March 22): Efforts by Britain's information watchdog to investigate Cambridge Analytica — the company at the centre of a storm over its use of Facebook data — were delayed on Thursday when a judge adjourned for 24 hours its application to search the company's head office. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) declined to comment on the reason for the delay. "A High Court judge has adjourned the ICO's application for a warrant relating to Cambridge Analytica until Friday," a spokeswoman said. ICO head Elizabeth Denham said three days ago she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after Britain's Channel 4 news secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections. Denham said then it would not take long for her organisation to obtain the warrant. Several Twitter users have been questioning the delay, including Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow who wrote before Thursday's adjournment: "Surely unbelievable that the UK's information commissioner is STILL waiting to see a judge who will grant a warrant to go in and search the premises ... by the time she gets in there how much evidence will be left?" Cambridge Analytica said on Tuesday: "We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection." Storage crates were collected from the building that houses its office on Tuesday, shortly before the company suspended its chief executive Alexander Nix. The political consultancy improperly accessed Facebook users' information to build profiles on millions of American voters that were later used to help elect US President Donald Trump in 2016, a whistleblower said on Saturday. Facebook's own forensic auditors — Stroz Friedberg — were in Cambridge Analytica's offices in central London on Monday to determine whether the firm still had the data, but left at the request of the British authorities. The data protection regulator had already demanded access to Cambridge Analytica's records and data — on March 7 — as part of an ongoing inquiry into how data was being used to target political messages. The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds (US$700,000) but will gain the power to fine an organisation up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.

Home Opinion Is Facebook to blame for data mining? Published 2 months ago on 23 March 2018 By Boo Su-Lyn MARCH 23 — The furore surrounding Cambridge Analytica makes it seem as if the British data analytics firm eats babies for breakfast.  A company, Global Science Research (GSR), took data from Facebook users who did a personality quiz on its app, as well as data from those users’ Facebook friends (through a friends permission feature that was available then before Facebook disabled it in mid-2014), which allowed it to have information on more than 50 million Facebook users. The test-takers had reportedly agreed to their data being collected for academic use, but their Facebook friends were unaware that their information too had been harvested. GSR allegedly sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica then allegedly used the Facebook data to create an algorithm to come up with convincing political messages for voters, which a whistleblower had described as “models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons ”. Talk about dramatic.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal has reached Malaysia too, as both Barisan Nasional (BN) and Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) accuse each other of contracting the company’s services during the 13th general election. Cambridge Analytica’s website said it had supported the Kedah BN campaign in Election 2013 with a “targeted messaging campaign” that highlighted school improvements. The Prime Minister’s Office claimed neither BN nor the government had ever hired Cambridge Analytica or its parent company SCL Group, pointing to an SCL representative who said he reported “directly” to Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir. Mukhriz was with Umno back then in 2013 and became Kedah mentri besar after the election. SCL Group South-east Asia chief Azrin Zizal , who was Mukhriz’s former media officer, mirrored the official narrative, even though Mukhriz had contested Election 2013 as an Umno candidate, not an independent. (Why is it such a big deal for a company to try to figure out what makes people tick and to sell its insights to politicians? Claims that Cambridge Analytica can read people’s minds or brainwash them are probably over-the-top embellishments of its capabilities. Cambridge Analytica’s website said it had supported the Kedah BN campaign in Election 2013 with a ‘targeted messaging campaign’ that highlighted school improvements. — Bernama pic Sure it can test political catchphrases like “drain the swamp” and predict their popularity for use in an actual campaign. But how is that any different from other companies holding focus groups to test their products? There appears to be two factors behind the public outrage: Facebook’s use of our personal data and the spread of fake news on social media. It makes no sense for people to be angry at Facebook, a free service, for allowing third parties access to their data for commercial reasons. (Facebook has since tightened its privacy controls ). How can we demand for free things and expect a business to magically sustain itself? It is like asking for quality journalism, but refusing to pay for it and complaining about the state of the press. If we want to be able to contact a long-lost school friend or to leave mean comments on a Facebook post we find offensive, then we must be willing to pay the price, i.e. give away our data. It is absurd to expect privacy for anything we post online. If we really want to safeguard our data, then we just have to go off the grid. On the use of disinformation in political campaigns, Facebook, as a platform, should not be held responsible for the spread of fake news or any sort of content that is considered offensive. It is content creators who should have primary responsibility. Why are we blaming Facebook for showing us only content that we like? If we want to know both sides of the story, then all we have to do is follow the Facebook pages of personalities or organisations we abhor. If we are upset at Cambridge Analytica for supposedly exploiting our trust of our own friends above other institutions when it comes to information, then we need to get a reality check. Our friends and acquaintances have their own biases and prejudices; some are also more susceptible to sharing social media posts without doing some quick verification on Google first. We need to start taking some responsibility for ourselves instead of blaming tech companies for creating an echo chamber that we willingly are part of. It is not that difficult to look for alternative viewpoints or news sources. It doesn’t take all that much time either to Google something to check if it is old news or a hoax, instead of mindlessly forwarding it to a dozen WhatsApp groups. Instead of demanding for more regulation that could destroy Facebook’s great democratic openness, we should become smarter consumers. In the interest of free speech, people should be able to say whatever they want, including racist and sexist things, as long as physical harm is not advocated. If a campaign spreads a video claiming that a political party wants to get rid of so-called Malay rights or that another party is corrupt to the core, the targets just need to explain why such claims are wrong. It may be simplistic to expect people to have common sense and to not fall for racist campaigning or fear mongering, but I believe that we need to trust our own ability to self-regulate instead of asking the State to control us. * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.

Home Opinion Facebook’s chronic evasions are dangerous business — Bloomberg Editorial Published 2 months ago on 23 March 2018 By Bloomberg MARCH 23 — Facebook’s business model is pretty simple. It offers a free service to connect users with loved ones and others of similar interests. In return, it collects data about what its users do online (and, increasingly, offline). It then uses this data to sell targeted advertising. The whole thing works brilliantly.  Yet the company — like so many others that profit from selling access to their users’ data — seems reluctant to describe so explicitly how it makes money. Instead, in response to news that data from as many as 50 million users was gathered and shared by a third party without their knowledge, Facebook issued a statement that begins: “Protecting people’s information is the most important thing we do at Facebook.” There is always some distance between what a company says it does and what it actually does. For Facebook, it’s greater than most. And — unlike for many companies — this disconnect is no longer an abstract concern. As the network assumes a central role in public life in the US and elsewhere, it is warping politics and misleading voters. Facebook’s cherished myth that it’s simply “bringing the world closer together” is becoming hard to defend. Its latest scandal offers a case in point. In 2014, a researcher got permission from both Facebook and about 270,000 users to gather personal data about them. He then shared that data — and that of about 50 million of their Facebook friends — with a company called Cambridge Analytica, which used it to create “psychographic” profiles of voters and later worked for the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.  Sharing data without users’ consent is “against our policies,” says Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and CEO. But the larger question, for regulators as much as the company itself, is how much control users should have over Facebook’s vast repository of personal data, which has become an immensely powerful political tool with few safeguards to speak of. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted the social media network made mistakes in letting 50 million users' data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. — Reuters pic The Trump team used such tools to great effect. It tested tens of thousands of ad variations on the network. It used Facebook data to deliver provocative messages to receptive subsets of the electorate — knowing the broader public would be none the wiser — while conducting “major voter suppression operations” to dampen turnout for Trump’s opponent. As it happens, Russia had the same idea. This stuff only works because Facebook furtively collects so much intimate information. Its business is selling data about its users. And data has no values or principles of its own. It can help elect a good candidate or a bad one. It can be used for valuable research or vile psychological experiments. It can reveal stunningly personal details — and it is now in the hands of a huge range of people, responsible and otherwise. Facebook has every right to make money. But the company — and its billions of users, for that matter, as well as the few billion remaining humans who have yet to join — shouldn’t delude themselves about how it does so. Only then will they be able to clearly measure the consequences of their choices. — Bloomberg View * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.

Sarawak Report, in the March 20 article, claimed that Petronas was used as a front to channel the monies to SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, back in 2014. The portal claimed that it sighted an 85-page proposal provided to Petronas in 2014 “which clearly indicate” that the company paid SCL Group over US$2 million “to target and influence key opinion formers in swing constituencies in Sabah and Sarawak specifically in favour of the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition”. “Petronas was moreover instructed to provide full financial support to a plainly expensive parallel operation anticipated by the company, which was to target the wider Malaysian media in order to cultivate journalists into providing friendly coverage,” Sarawak Report claimed. Cambridge Analytica is a London-based data firm, famous for being hired by the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 US presidential election. The company has been in the local spotlight following an undercover report by Britain’s Channel 4 News on March 19, which caught on video executives of the company mentioning that it has conducted data mining and analysis to provide targeted messaging services in Malaysia. The Prime Minister’s Office has since issued a statement denying that BN has ever hired Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group. But it added that the SCL Group country representative had confirmed that “Cambridge Analytica’s advice on the 2013 general election was provided personally to [Datuk Seri] Mukhriz Mahathir, PPBM’s deputy president”. SCL Group Southeast Asia chief Azrin Zizal, who claimed he was a former press officer for Mukhriz up until 2015, said he provided the firm’s advice to the former boss to bring Kedah under BN’s banner in the 2013 election. Mukhriz, however, has said he is “not aware” of Cambridge Analytica’s involvement in Kedah during the election. He also said Azrin had only worked under him until 2013.

Home Opinion Facebook’s PR crisis is largely self-inflicted — Kara Alaimo Published 2 months ago on 22 March 2018 By Bloomberg MARCH 22 — Facebook is dealing with one of the biggest crises in its history this week, after it admitted on Friday that it has known since 2015 that Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm that worked on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, improperly accessed data on 50 million of its users.  On Monday, the company’s stock experienced its largest decline in four years; the social media giant lost a staggering US$37 billion in market value in one day. The incident intensified on Tuesday, with Democratic and Republican senators calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Bloomberg News reporting that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether the company breached a consent decree. The European Union is also investigating. The founder of WhatsApp called on users to delete Facebook. And it’s only Wednesday.  The company’s executives are reportedly worried about how all of this will affect their personal reputations — and they should be. Much of this damage has been self-inflicted. The poor judgment Facebook exercised in handling this matter is mind-boggling. As anyone with even a small amount of experience managing crises could have told the company, the worst decision an organisation can make in such a situation is to stay silent. If Facebook had disclosed what it knew as soon as the problem occurred and then followed up with steps to protect user privacy, it could have resolved the issue without outside interference and the financial and reputational losses it’s now experiencing. Instead, the incident has spiraled out of Facebook’s control. There’s a simple reason why disclosure is the most effective strategy in a crisis: The truth always emerges. In the US, even classified government documents are regularly leaked. So a company facing a problem has two choices: to admit what happened immediately and ideally get some points for being transparent, or to try to cover things up and later be blamed for both the initial problem and the subsequent deceit. That’s why any good crisis expert will tell an organisation to fess up about everything as soon as possible. It will face an initial round of negative media coverage. But if the company has truly come clean and then works to fix the underlying problem, the media will be left with nothing more to report. It’s the fastest and easiest way to make a problem go away. By contrast, Facebook waited three years to disclose this incident. That’s what has led to so much outrage and so many investigations. If the company had immediately announced the breach, lawmakers and the public would still have had a lot of questions about how it protects user data. However, Facebook would have avoided the charges of secrecy that have now led so many people (including me) to question its underlying values. One reason Facebook may have decided to withhold the information for so long is that it was trying to figure out how to prevent such episodes from happening again. However, companies don’t need to resolve a problem fully before they disclose it. Helio Fred Garcia, president of the Logos Consulting Group and author of The Agony of Decision: Mental Readiness and Leadership in a Crisis , says that a company determining how to address a crisis should ask itself this question: “What would reasonable people appropriately expect a responsible organisation or leader to do when facing this kind of situation?” Reasonable people wouldn’t expect a company that just learned that its data has been improperly shared to have developed a full plan within minutes to prevent such a situation from recurring. They would, however, expect the company to be transparent, express remorse, pledge to take action to prevent the problem from happening again, and follow up with an announcement about what it was doing to solve the underlying issue. If Facebook had done this, it wouldn’t be dealing with the mess it’s in today. What’s more, such a strategy would likely have allowed the company to determine how to solve the problem itself. If Facebook had quickly implemented measures to better protect the privacy of its users, it would have been unnecessary for lawmakers to step in and mandate them. Self-designed solutions would almost certainly have been more palatable to the company than the kinds of changes now likely to be imposed from the outside.    That strategy is still the company’s best bet now — even though it will continue to suffer massive reputational damage for its delay. The fact that Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg have stayed silent until now suggests, astonishingly, that they still haven’t learned this rudimentary lesson. Zuckerberg will reportedly speak over the next 24 hours. According to Axios, the delay has been because “he wanted to say something meaningful rather than just rushing out.” But of course, it’s been deeply damaging for him to let others speculate about his thoughts for the past five days, rather than making a statement himself about this problem he has apparently known about for three years. It’s no surprise that Facebook stock plummeted. Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist of the global communications agency Weber Shandwick, writes in her book Corporate Reputation that 63 per cent of a company’s market value is attributable to its public image. If Facebook had following basic, well-established principles of crisis communications, it wouldn’t now be dealing with a full-fledged catastrophe that is mostly of its own making. — Bloomberg * Kara Alaimo is an assistant professor of public relations at Hofstra University and author of ‘Pitch, Tweet, or Engage on the Street: How to Practice Global Public Relations and Strategic Communication.’ She previously served in the Obama administration. ** This is the personal opinion of the columnist.

InternetNZ CE Jordan Carter says, "Our purpose is to promote the benefits of the Internet and protect its potential, which means ensuring New Zealanders are informed, empowered, and safe online. "We agree there are real concerns raised by large-scale sharing and use of user data, but there is also a risk that knee-jerk responses fail to address broader problems. "The same platforms that connect people also track their activity, and can feed targeted advertising and other content to influence people’s behaviour as consumers and citizens. "There are issues here around sovereignty, the value and use of data and the implications of data management. There’s a real need to open a conversation here in New Zealand about these issues. Addressing Internet issues like this one is part of our purpose. "We welcome investigations by UK authorities into whether the use of this data in this way was unlawful. But even with the best individual privacy protections, there are broader issues including society-wide impacts of data use and sharing," says Jordan Carter. InternetNZ will be exploring these issues further in 2018. We will support informed discussion on the Privacy Bill introduced to Parliament this week, and will be providing forums and analysis to support this vital conversation, as part of our ongoing work to promote the Internet’s benefits and protect its potential.

CM_ME_MC_Responsive_AP   “The Israeli Privacy Protection Authority informed Facebook today (on Thursday), that it had opened an investigation into its activities, following the publications on the transfers of personal data from Facebook to Cambridge Analytica, and the possibility of other infringements of privacy law regarding Israelis,” the Justice Ministry was quoted as saying.   Under the Israeli Privacy Law, personal data may only be used for the purpose for which it was given, with the consent of the individual.   The Privacy Protection Authority will “investigate whether personal data of Israeli citizens were illegally used in a way that infringes upon their right to privacy and the provisions of the Israeli Privacy Law,” a statement said.   Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting company, was accused of harvesting data of up to 50 million Facebook users without permission and using the data to help politicians including US President Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign.   On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologised for the “major breach of trust,” saying the company would take measures to protect personal data.    Facebook CM_ME_EOP_Responsive_AP  Tweet  Related post Facebook to make ad scrutiny more stringent Facebook says no to third-party data for targeted ads Facebook to get stricter regulations from German government ‘Delete’ Facebook, says WhatsApp co-founder articles-wrapper col-md-8 CM_ME_TRS_Responsive_AP Recent Post   Volvo bets on electrified vehicles, looks at higher growth   Kolkata, June 1 (IANS): Swedish luxury automobiles major Volvo Car India, which is betting big on... more»   Endangered mountain gorilla population recovers to over 1,000   Gihishamwotzi, 18, an endangered silverback high mountain gorilla from Sabyinyo family, rests atop... more»   EU, West urge Maldives to hold credible, transparent presidential poll   Maldives’ former president Mohamed Nasheed leaves after a news conference in Colombo, Sri... more»   EU confident Italy’s new government will cooperate with partners   European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

Amidst all the controversy regarding the data leak by a certain British firm, Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence to clarify that his company is working on boosting the security features of the social media platform ahead of the elections in India. The comments come after Zuckerberg admitted to having made mistakes in the past by saying a breach of trust has happened.   The Facebook CEO revealed in an interview to CNN that attempts have been made in the past by countries like Russia to interfere with the elections held in the United States. Zuckerberg added by mentioning the AI tools that had been deployed to identify and remove fake accounts that tried manipulating news and thus influencing the elections.   Zuckerberg said “We have a responsibility to do this, not only for the 2018 midterms in the U.S., which are going to be a huge deal this year and that's just a huge focus for us but there's a big election in India this year, there's a big election in Brazil, there are big elections around the world, and you can bet that we are really committed to doing everything that we need to make sure that the integrity of those elections on Facebook is secured”.   He also mentioned that “Russian bots” were also involved in attempts to influence the 2017 French elections and also the polls for the Alabama Senate. Zuckerberg clarified that his company needs to up its game if it plans to match up to the efforts of Russia and other governments in being more sophisticated in election interference.   The reference to Indian elections came after India had warned Facebook of “stringent” action for having allowed data theft.

INLINE RELATED POSTS 1/3 //   Target’s infamous analytics campaign found a teen was pregnant before her parents Not just political data firms – data mining has long been used by credit card companies to create psychographic profiles of the users’ behaviour & habits culled from data generated from website browsing, online purchases and ATM withdrawals. Increasingly, financial profiles of users are being mixed with behavioural profiles and shipped to third-party agencies.  This data is used for customer profiling and for targeted customer acquisition. A slew of targeted analytics campaigns shine a spotlight on how big companies who have access to petabytes of users’ private information violate the basic ethical principles: 1) Target used data mining to find out whether a female customer is pregnant: 2) Orbitz targeted Apple customers with an analytics program 3) FB tweaked user sentiment in an experiment: Big Data Scientist Michal Kosinski  An earlier MIT report highlighted that if companies wish to mine user data without alienating them, they should adhere to a privacy by design policy.

Photo: Reuters HIGHLIGHTS Congress to move privilege motion against Sushma Swaraj Congress accuses Sushma of misleading families of 39 Indians who were killed in Iraq Parliament too was misled by the Modi govt, says Congress Two days after Sushma Swaraj confirmed that the 39 missing Indians in Mosul, Iraq, were dead, the Congress today said that it will move a privilege motion against the External Affairs Minister for misleading the families of the deceased as well as Parliament. Senior Congress leader Ambika Soni said, "We are going to bring a privilege motion against the External Affairs Minister for misleading the families of the 39 Indians as well as the House." The decision to move a privilege motion against Sushma Swaraj comes hours after Rahul Gandhi accused the government of "inventing" Congress' link to data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica and diverting public attention from the death of 39 Indians in Iraq. "Problem: 39 Indians dead; Govt on the mat, caught lying. Solution: Invent story on Congress and Data Theft. Result: Media networks bite bait; 39 Indians vanish from radar. Problem solved," the Congress president said in a tweet. Problem: 39 Indians dead; Govt on the mat, caught lying. Solution: Invent story on Congress & Data Theft. Result: Media networks bite bait; 39 Indians vanish from radar. Problem solved. Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) March 22, 2018 Since Sushma Swaraj confirmed the 39 deaths in Iraq, the affected families have demanded that the DNA test reports of the deceased be shared with them. "We demand from the government to provide us DNA reports. We had been running from pillar to post since four years and now we are being told via television that we lost one of our own," said Gurpinder Kaur, who lost her brother Manjinder Singh. The Opposition has mounted a fierce attack on the Modi government for "misleading" the country and the family members of those killed by the ISIS in Iraq. "The Modi government has crossed all limits of insensitivity. The Indian government had on seven occasions told the families of the 39 Indians kidnapped by ISIS in Iraq that they were alive. The question is why did the Modi government mislead the nation and the family members of those Indians kidnapped by ISIS," Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. Sushma Swaraj has maintained that the government did not believe in declaring a missing person as dead. "I refused to close the files (of the 39 Indians) till we had concrete proof in hand (about their death)," she said replying to questions on why government gave hope to the families of the 39 missing Indians since 2014. The External Affairs Minister said that reports of the DNA identification arrived on Monday. Sushma Swaraj said 100 per cent identification was possible for 38 bodies and 70 per cent for the remaining one.

We are living in a perception-based era." Related 'How can you win elections with a mobile phone?' Ever since British data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica came in controversy after a few newspapers reported it had harvested personal data about Facebook users for election messaging, there are concerns over elections being influenced by unfair use of data analytics. The controversy has not only impacted the US and the UK but India too. Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI), the Indian partner of Cambridge Analytica and SCL, has used data analytics to influence several elections since 2010. "In early 2010, we were developing new political tools using mobiles. Back then we were just discovering the power of the changes afoot. I remember some politicians would ask me ‘how can you win elections with a mobile phone or computer'?" said OBI head Amrish Tyagi in an interview to ET last year. Winning elections with mobile phone is an accurate description of the art and craft of Tyagi's company. In 2016, Tyagi, the son of politician KC Tyagi, helped Donald Trump win the US elections. The Ghaziabad resident was part of an elite team put together by big data-led political communication consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Update: The website of OBI was suspended on Wednesday night after the BJP and the Congress accused each other of availing of its services for electoral campaigns. "Earlier elections were driven by rural areas. But after globalisation, things changed. Before, elders of the family or its oldest member decided who the rest would vote for. Today the highest earner decides. They are usually the young who’ve moved to cities. When they return home, they make the call based on what’s happening in cities. They are all on social media. India has 60 crore social media users," Tyagi told ET. Tyagi explained why mobile phone can shape people's opinion in India—because it links people to social media. "The role of social media is critical because you have to create a brand now. The individual brand is more important. Shaping, changing and making perception on social media is easy. We are living in a perception-based era. What’s in WhatsApp is reality," he said. Messaging through mobile phone can mould mass opinion much faster than any other means such as speeches or posters. Earlier, one wrong step by a politician before elections could wipe out months of messaging he had done. But now his image can be salvaged quickly through mobile phones. Tyagi cited an example to prove this point. "I remember sitting in the war room during the Bihar assembly elections in 2015. Suddenly a photo from 2014 of Nitish Kumarji hugging a tantrik showed up in the feeds. It went viral very quickly. We had to counter this. Within a few minutes, we came out with a 2014 photo of Smriti Irani in which she was showing her hand to an astrologer in Rajasthan who told her that she will very soon be the president of India. You have to be very quick to counter," he said. It is more than evident that what people think of a politician and his plank is now a matter of what kind of messaging he is able to do. If he has the power of data analytics at his command, he can turn the tables on his opponents through just a mobile phone. Tyagi did that for Trump in the 2016 US elections. Tyagi’s team suggested that Trump’s daughter-in-law celebrate Diwali at a Hindu temple in Virginia, an important swing-state. "My role was to figure the concerns of the Indian-American population. At the time, they were a bit afraid of Trump’s views on jobs and immigrants. My research threw up interesting results. While afraid for their jobs, Indian-Americans were ideologically closer to Trump. For instance, his hard stance on Pakistan. We suggested he stop targeting Indian jobs. As the elections progressed we saw Trump praising Indians for their contributions and intelligence," Tyagi said. On the fairness on the methods adopted by Cambridge Analytica, Tyagi said the information was gathered from the public domain. "Once you win an election, opponents invariably target you. When it’s a big election, different allegations surface. Most of the information we gather is in public domain. Based on where you shop, the music you buy from the Apple store, trips to the hair salon. It’s easy nowadays to identify individual tastes and habits. And then accordingly, create messages. Every day we receive commercial messages," Tyagi said.

Logout India Insider Tech Careers Finance Strategy Life Politics › › Mozilla will pause paying for ads on Facebook because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal James Cook Facebook Linkedin WhatsApp Twitter Google+ Reddit Software company Mozilla has announced that it's pausing paying for ads on Facebook because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company said that it will consider restarting the ads when Facebook strengthens its default privacy settings. It has also launched a petition calling for more strict default privacy settings. Software company Mozilla has announced that it's pausing its advertising on Facebook because of the ongoing Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company said in a blog post published on Wednesday that "When Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, specifically strengthening its default privacy settings for third party apps, we'll consider returning." Mozilla's foundation is also running a petition calling on Facebook to change default app permissions and "respect" its users. Here's Mozilla's full blog post: "Mozilla is pressing pause on our Facebook advertising. Facebook knows a great deal about their two billion users - perhaps more intimate information than any other company does. They know everything we click and like on their site, and know who our closest friends and relationships are. Because of its scale, Facebook has become one of the most convenient platforms to reach an audience for all companies and developers, whether a multibillion corporation or a not-for-profit. We understand that Facebook took steps to limit developer access to friends' data beginning in 2014. This was after Facebook started its relationship with Cambridge University Professor Aleksandr Kogan, whose decision to share data he collected from Facebook with Cambridge Analytica is currently in the news. This news caused us to take a closer look at Facebook's current default privacy settings given that we support the platform with our advertising dollars. While we believe there is still more to learn, we found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data - particularly with respect to settings for third party apps. We are encouraged that Mark Zuckerberg has promised to improve the privacy settings and make them more protective. When Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, specifically strengthening its default privacy settings for third party apps, we'll consider returning. We look forward to Facebook instituting some of the things that Zuckerberg promised today."

Zuckerberg, in an interview with The New York Times , referred to the artificial intelligence tools deployed by Facebook to detect fake accounts trying to manipulate news and influence the elections. The tool was deployed for the first time in the French elections in 2017. The new AI tools we built after the 2016 elections found more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U.S. in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France. “Last year in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new AI tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those,” Zuckerberg said.  Also Read: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg Has No Way Out of This Quagmire This is for the first time that Zuckerberg has publicly talked about Facebook being allegedly used for influencing polls. I feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. “This is a massive focus for us to make sure we’re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important,” Zuckerberg said. Responding to a question, he said there is a lot of hard work ahead for Facebook to make it harder for countries like Russia to interfere in elections, and to ensure that trolls and others can’t spread fake news. Also Read: Facebook's Zuckerberg Outlines Steps to Protect User Data “But we can get in front of this, and we have a responsibility to do this not only for the 2018 midterms in the U.S., which are going to be a huge deal this year, and that’s just a huge focus of us,” the social media giant’s CEO said. There’s a big election in India this year. There’s a big election in Brazil. There are big elections around the world, and you can bet that we are really committed to doing everything that we need to, to make sure that the integrity of those elections on Facebook is secured. India yesterday warned Facebook of “stringent” action for any attempt to influence polls by allowing data theft and even threatened to summon Zuckerberg if needed. The warning came as the BJP yesterday attacked Congress, questioning the party’s relations with Cambridge Analytica, accused of harvesting personal data from 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge. The opposition party, however, asserted that the services of the London-based company have never been hired by his party or its chief Rahul Gandhi. Zuckerberg also told CNN that he is sure that someone is trying to meddle the 2018 midterm elections in the U.S. “I’m sure someone’s trying,” he said when asked about the possibility of meddling happening right now. I’m sure that there’s v2, version two, of whatever the Russian effort was in 2016, I’m sure they’re working on that,” he said. “And there are going to be some new tactics that we need to make sure that we observe and get in front of,” he added. Also Read: Facebook Has Endured Potholes, But Data Crisis May Be a Crater Noting that Facebook officials “have some sense of the different things that we need to get in front of,” Zuckerberg said the company staffers are “building technology” and hiring human reviewers to stamp out propaganda and other attacks. “One of the big commitments that we’ve made this year is to double the number of people working on security at the company. We're going to have 20,000 people working on security and content review in this company by the end of this year," said the Facebook founder and CEO. Responding to a question, Zuckerberg said he is not sure if Facebook should be regulated. I actually am not sure we shouldn’t be regulated. You know, I think in general, technology is an increasingly important trend in the world, and I actually think the question is more what is the right regulation rather than yes or no, should it be regulated. Zuckerberg has apologised for a "major breach of trust" with Facebook users and vowed to take steps to protect user data. He admitted of making "mistakes" and said he was "happy" to answer questions about the scandal before U.S. Congress. He said Facebook has already taken important steps to prevent such a situation from happening again. He said the site would be reviewing thousands of apps in an "intensive process.

Logout India Insider Tech Careers Finance Strategy Life Politics › › Everything happening to Facebook stems from its radical thesis of 'Move fast and break things' Shona Ghosh Facebook Linkedin WhatsApp Twitter Google+ Reddit Facebook was responsible for a massive shift away from the idea that the internet is full of strangers and it's dangerous to share your data. It encouraged people to be super-social within its platform, because there's nothing wrong with sharing all your information with people you already know in real life. This turned out to be a terrible idea when combined with Facebook's early motto of "Move fast and break things." Facebook executives seem to know that this attitude towards sharing, integral to the company's growth, was a bad, naive thesis. Remember when the concept of "stranger danger" applied to the internet? Pre-Facebook, it was common to have Hotmail or MySpace user names that were something like cuteface56, because the idea of volunteering your real name and location to complete strangers seemed insane. Facebook reversed all of this and normalised the idea that sharing everything about yourself on the internet was normal, even beneficial and fun. It did this by upending the idea that the internet is full of strangers - Facebook centres on connecting you with people you already know in real life. With that apparently safe premise, what could go wrong with sharing huge amounts about yourself on the platform? This pro-sharing attitude was coupled with an unofficial motto: "Move fast and break things." It turns out that was a disastrous combination. Facebook can lay the blame for all that is happening to the company right now on decisions it made a decade ago to pursue social sharing and growth at the expensive of privacy. That's becoming increasingly obvious as the details of how Cambridge Analytica harvested up to 50 million users' profiles come into focus. To understand how this came about, we need to return to Facebook's first ever F8 developer conference in 2007, when the company was in "move fast" mode, and not thinking so much about how it might "break things." At the time, a youthful Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook Platform. This would open up Facebook - then at 24 million users - to third-party developers who could build fun games and apps that would make the service more fun to use. It was literally described as the "anti-Myspace," which didn't have much truck with third-party apps. It was a huge deal for developers, who looked on at Facebook's growth in awe and now had access to a massive base of social media users. Even in 2007, Facebook had around 50- to 60 million users and this would grow more than six-fold by 2009. In a 2008 interview, Mark Zuckerberg would say of Platform : "All we're trying to do in Facebook is take the social graph that already exists in the world and map it out ... Once it's mapped out, expose it in a way users are comfortable with to business applications." According to former Facebook worker-turned-whistleblower Sandy Parakilas, Facebook was too caught up in trying to become a platform to bother with policing how third parties were using sensitive user information. Parakilas was once Facebook Platform operations manager, overseeing how third-party developers accessed the site's user data. He blew the whistle to The Guardian about how the firm took minimal steps to protect that data, sacrificing privacy and security at the altar of growth. And speaking to British politicians during a select committee hearing on Wednesday, he said: "The way I would characterise it: Its unofficial motto was move fast and break things. That was mostly around growth in the number of people who used the service. And at the time of the platform team, it was about growth in apps, growth in developers, building things very quickly and getting lots of people using the service ... The most popular apps had huge scale. Some of those apps asked for friend permissions. There was a huge amount of data that was being pulled out of Facebook as a result, and it was a concern to me." The biggest misstep was letting those external apps scrape both user data and friend data, without people explicitly giving permission. Another was failing to take an interest in what developers might be doing with that data. That lack of oversight allowed research firm Global Science Research to scrape data from thousands of Facebook users , then allegedly sell that information on to political research firm Cambridge Analytica, violating Facebook's rules. "Once the data passed from Facebook's servers, Facebook lost insight into what was being done with the data, and lost control over [it.]," said Parakilas. Now Facebook is paying the price, and its executives seem to know it. In a contrite Facebook post , the firm's vice president for consumer hardware Andrew Bosworth wrote something significant about its attitudes in 2014. Here's what he wrote, emphasis ours: "We thought that every app could be social. Your calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures. It was a reasonable vision but it didn't materialize the way we had hoped . We made a change three years ago to limit developer access to detailed friend data." It probably isn't coincidence that Facebook started moving away from the "Move fast and break things" motto around the same time it realised unfettered social access might have consequences. But four years down the line, we should wonder what else Facebook broke.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence about the crisis over political-advertising firm Cambridge Analytica’s access to user data on the social network, giving a series of interviews to media organizations Wednesday including The New York Times, Wired, CNN and Recode. Zuckerberg acknowledged Facebook’s mishandling of the data and pledged to take steps to restore the public trust. He said Facebook will inform every one of its two billion-plus users that may have been compromised and promised to investigate whether Cambridge Analytica still holds the information it obtained from a third-party app creator. Facebook is also widening its probe into whether other developers may have run afoul of the company’s rules. The stock has dropped almost 10 percent since last Friday when Facebook said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica from its platform. It was down 1.6 percent Thursday to $166.73 at 10:34 a.m. in New York. Here is an abridged summary of his comments to the various news outlets: The New York Times --On how many apps Facebook will investigate: “It will be in the thousands.” --On the #DeleteFacebook campaign to ditch the social media company: “I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it’s not good. I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don’t feel good about using Facebook, that’s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify.” --On plans to avoid foreign interference in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections: “I feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. This is a massive focus for us to make sure we’re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important.” --On Facebook’s basic economic model: “I don’t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it’s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.” WIRED --On philosophical changes Zuckerberg has mulled since the crisis erupted: “Early on on the platform we had this very idealistic vision around how data portability would allow all these different new experiences, and I think the feedback that we’ve gotten from our community and from the world is that privacy and having the data locked down is more important to people than maybe making it easier to bring more data and have different kinds of experiences. And I think if we’d internalized that sooner and had made these changes that we made in 2014 in, say, 2012 or 2010 then I also think we could have avoided a lot of harm.” CNN --On regulation: “I actually am not sure we shouldn’t be regulated. There are things like ads transparency regulation that I would love to see.” --On calls to testify before Congress: “The short answer is I’m happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.” RECODE --On Facebook’s responsibility to weed out bad actors on the platform: “What I would really like to do is find a way to get our policies set in the way that reflects the values of the community, so I’m not the one making those decisions. I feel fundamentally uncomfortable sitting here in California at an office, making content policy decisions for people around the world.” -- On whether Facebook can retrieve data from third party developers: “Not always.” The audits “will clean up a lot of data, and going forward the more important thing is just preventing this from happening in the first place and that’s going to be solved by restricting the amount of data that developers can have access to.” --On the cost to Facebook: “We’re going to be investigating and reviewing tens of thousands of apps from before 2014, and assuming that there’s some suspicious activity we’re probably going to be doing a number of formal audits, so I think this is going to be pretty expensive. I think this is going to cost many millions of dollars and take a number of months and hopefully not longer than that in order to get this fully complete.”   ©2018 Bloomberg L.P.

Alleging that the BJP has dished out fake news for long, Singhvi said spreading of false information has been its forte. "BJP is the party in power. Rather than holding press conferences, why doesnt it take action?" he said about Union Law and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasads charge yesterday that the opposition party was using data manipulation and theft to woo voters. "The BJP has misused the company many times and is now casting aspersions on us out of fear," he said. "The BJP has been spreading false information since the days of Rajiv Gandhi ... Dishing out fake news is its forte," he added. Any attempt by social media sites, including Facebook, to influence Indias electoral process through undesirable means will not be tolerated, Prasad told reporters in Delhi yesterday. Stating that party spokesman Randeep Surjewala has refuted the allegations of misuse of social media by the Congress, Singhvi alleged that it was the BJP which has misused the platform to spread canards against his party and its leaders. "Paid garbage is posted by goons of the BJP," Singhvi alleged. The BJP and the Congress yesterday traded charges over a Facebook data scandal involving private firm Cambridge Analytica, with the ruling party accusing its rival of "data theft" to woo voters ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, a claim the opposition party rejected. Prasad had cited several media reports which said the company would work for Congress chief Rahul Gandhi ahead of the next Lok Sabha polls. Cambridge Analytica is accused of illegally harvesting personal information from Facebook to influence polls in several countries. The Congress also hit back alleging that the "BJPs factory of fake news has produced one more fake product", and accused it of hiring the firms services in several elections, including in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

But you don't have to do anything as radical as deleting the app that keeps you in touch with friends, family members and so many Russian bots. Instead, consider taking full control of your account. A few steps can help turning Facebook into a more benign app. Photo: Dado Ruvic A few steps can eliminate Facebook as a nefarious actor in your life, wrestling it into submission as a benign app. I have been a skeptic about Facebook pretty much from the beginning -- it's likely a generational thing. I have had issues with the lack of privacy protections and how the company monetised me as a user. A precept from the 1970s, said originally about television, is applicable to technology and media: If you are not paying for a product, then you are the product. Advertisement Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, understood this from the beginning. He is of the generation that never really cared much about privacy or data security. What made Facebook so valuable was its business model of monetising private information and online behaviour. In light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, people are now waking up to how dangerous that model can be. In theory, the idea of an app that connects you to friends from primary school, summer camp or high school, or to people who share your interests, to your uni friends and former co-workers, should be harmless fun. In practice, it is fraught with danger. You can dramatically reduce those risks by making some small changes in your Facebook behaviour. Like any new habit, it will take a month or two to get used to it. My experience has been that the trade-offs for doing these steps are ultimately worth it. - Log out and stop 'liking': When you are using FB, log in as normal. Do whatever you want to do. Then LOG OUT. That is not easy to find -- by design. Look for it in the dropdown menu under the little triangle on the far right of the screen. Log out is the bottom menu option. How Facebook uses your data and personal web browsing history may be the least understood aspect of the app. Many sites provide advice on stopping Facebook from tracking you while browsing. These approaches help somewhat, but aren't foolproof. And Facebook still gets anonymous data from third parties; they can and do match this data to your identity. One other thing: stop clicking "like" on other sites: doing so shares data with Facebook about where you are and what you are doing. Your choices are not anonymous. - Adjust privacy settings: Go to your Settings (also under that inverted triangle). There are 15 topics (found on far left of screen -- General, Privacy, etc.). Set as many things as possible to the most private possible setting -- "Private" and "Only me" are the strongest, then "Only friends." Work your way through each of the privacy settings, turning off location tracking (No, do not "check in" anywhere, you reckless fool). Also, go to the advertising preferences, and set that on the most reduced setting. The setting "Friends of friends" is an invitation for trolls and others to access your information. Be aware of the personal information you are sharing with strangers. Speaking of which: - Strip out personal information: First, understand that whatever you voluntarily put on Facebook can and will be eventually used or shared (note my actual birthday is accurate, but not the year of my birth). It serves little purpose there -- other than helping Facebook hit its revenue goals -- so get rid of as much of it as you can. What music or books you like, where you have worked, the places you visit: None of this makes much of a difference, other than creating a profile to serve advertising to you or to be sold to third parties. Note you cannot get rid of an email address, so I use Leemail, a specific program that allows me to see when Facebook or others sell or otherwise share my email address. - UnFriend: Eliminate all of those in your friend list who have no real and true connection to you. This means mere acquaintances, friends of friends of friends, work colleagues from three jobs ago and random salespeople who may have reached out to you. Same with social groups, clubs, etc. that you are not active in. As with Twitter, you can take control of Facebook. It can be a useful app, if used with the appropriate degree of caution and security. The company is greatly incentivised to mine your information and behaviour for its profit. The onus is on you to protect your data and privacy, and yourself. Bloomberg  Social media Analysis Facebook Apps Most Viewed in Business Morning & Afternoon Newsletter Delivered Mon–Fri.

AMP is among those reviewing its stake in the social media behemoth after the personal information of 50 million users was reportedly collected by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Replay "The recent developments will be considered by the independent Ethics Committee at the next meeting," an AMP Capital spokesman said. The investment house has Responsible Investment Leaders funds with an ethics charter to screen sectors with “high negative social harm". This fund invests in Facebook. Its ethics committee checks its holdings three times a year to ensure environmental, social and corporate governance standards are maintained and has been “closely monitoring the data and privacy issues emerging in the realm of social media for some time”. Advertisement Across all of its funds, AMP has 1.445 million Facebook shares at a price of about $US169 each, according to Bloomberg. AMP Capital has $187.7 billion under management, with about $1.8 billion in its Responsible Investment Leaders funds. Facebook is also part of the investment mix at Australian Ethical, which has $2.6 billion under management and $9 million in Facebook. Head of ethics Stuart Palmer is watching the Facebook situation unfold “closely”. “Facebook is really polarising within society generally and at Australian Ethical," Dr Palmer said. “It’s obviously a major social issue, but also for investors generally. If they’re doing more harm than good, regulators can step in and people turn off and find alternatives,” he said. “If we form a view they disregard privacy, we won’t invest in them." Future Super, which puts companies through an ethical screening process and has $497 million under management, has had Facebook under "review" since February. It has about $4 million invested in the social giant. Founder and managing director of Future Super Simon Sheikh said "all technology" companies were struggling to ensure their platforms weren't being exploited. “In the case of Facebook , we’re seeing a pattern where serious issues around the use of their product are only being genuinely addressed once the issue has gained significant public attention,” he said. “The initial view from our analysts isn’t favourable, and over the next few weeks we’ll be engaging with our members, and others who rely on our ethical research, before finalising a decision on whether or not to divest from the company.” Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) chief executive Simon O’Connor said it was “not uncommon” for ethical international shares funds to have exposure to Facebook. “This will really send reverberations across the investment community to say security risks are very real from an investment and ethical perspective. There will be a lot of scrutiny on Facebook,” he said. “There have been lots of warnings for Facebook around this issue. The investment community will put them on watch.” Of 15 international share funds certified by the RIAA about half have exposure to Facebook. “Facebook has had plenty of warning about the risks to privacy and data issues,” he said. Right now, investors are asking “if they believe [Mark] Zuckerberg’s public statement about how it has been fixing the platform”. “If not they’ll probably sell their shares.” Investment app Acorns, which has more than $150 million under management in Australia, offers a portfolio option with a “socially responsible investment theme” that includes Facebook. It uses a portfolio of exchange traded funds (ETFs) including Betashare’s Global Sustainable Leaders. Acorns Australia head of brands and communication Queenie Ling said the choice was limited for socially conscious ETFs but it would carefully consider any new fund which “filters out data breaches, companies that minimise tax, companies that sub contract to firms with poor employment practices, or poor data privacy policies”. Nordic bank Nordea has decided to keep its current Facebook stake in its sustainable funds, but told Reuters its fund managers would not buy any more as a result of the revelations, strong public backlash and "overhanging threat" of regulation. Betashare did respond to a request for comment. Australian Super declined to comment. Cambridge Analytica used data obtained from Facebook to take election campaigns 'to the next level'.

Zuck spoke and the world listened.  But he may not have said enough to appease critics of the world's largest social network. After five days of silence and with the hashtags #WheresZuck and #DeleteFacebook trending on Twitter, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday addressed a major controversy over how  London-based consultancy Cambridge Analytica misused personal data from 50 million Facebook users . acknowledged that Facebook had made "mistakes" that led to a "breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it."  Zuckerberg makes Cambridge Analytica statement  In interviews with a few media outlets, including  CNN , the New York Times and  Wired  later in the day, Zuckerberg talked about things it seemed Facebook would never talk about. Asked about , Zuckerberg said he'd be open to it, particularly regulation related to ad transparency. "I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated," he said. He also said he'd consider testifying before Congress -- if he was the person at Facebook with the most information about the topic in question. Prominent senators, including Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner, have called for him to testify. (Facebook already testified before Congress last November over its role in the presidential election, but the company sent its top lawyer, and not Zuckerberg.) The interviews seemed intended to cast Zuckerberg as a chastened chief executive, opening up because Facebook's reputation had taken a beating for days as the public, privacy groups, legislators and Facebook users demanded answers. The company also took a financial hit, with its stock dropping 8.5 percent since news broke about the data exploit on March 16.  Both Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO and the other public face of the company, have said they're "sorry" about the incident. But Sandberg's apology went a little further, admitting, "I am so sorry that we let so many people down." "This is absolutely a turning point," said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst with the research firm Technalysis. "It's angered a lot of people." I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Facebook was criticized last week for having its platform exploited by Cambridge Analytica, a digital analytics firm hired by the Trump presidential campaign. According to Facebook, personal data from about 300,000 users was originally collected by a Cambridge lecturer named Aleksandr Kogan in 2013 for a personality quiz app. But given the way Facebook worked at the time, Kogan was able to access data from "tens of millions" of friends of those users, Zuckerberg said. While Kogan collected the data legitimately, he then violated Facebook's terms by passing the information to Cambridge Analytica. The social network, which boasts about 2 billion monthly users, found out about the infraction in 2015 but didn't inform the public. Instead, Facebook demanded that all the parties involved destroy the information. But reports late last week revealed that not all the data had in fact been deleted. a former data scientist for Cambridge Analytica, brought that story to the New York Times and The Guardian. The blowup then raised questions about Facebook's treatment of data and whether it's doing enough to protect it. The situation was exacerbated by the lack of response from Facebook leadership. Sandberg said she regrets not speaking up sooner. "Sometimes, and I would say certainly this past week, we speak too slowly," she said on CNBC . "If I could live this past week again, I would have definitely had Mark and myself out speaking earlier, but we were trying to get to the bottom of this." 'Lingering under the surface' Part of the reason the public outcry has been so loud is that people have become increasingly fed up with the social media giant, O'Donnell said. Zuckerberg and his team were already under fire for Facebook's mishandling of fake news spread on its platform and for during the 2016 presidential election. "It's been lingering under the surface for a while," O'Donnell said.  Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on Wednesday vowed to make changes to the platform so a similar exploit would never happen again. Facebook said it will "investigate" all apps that have access to large amounts of data, and restrict developers' data access even further. Zuckerberg told the New York Times on Wednesday that the number of apps is in "the thousands." He also said that Facebook will notify "anyone whose data may have been shared." Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and data mining: What you need to know Zuckerberg vows changes to Facebook after Cambridge Analytica scandal How to delete your Facebook account once and for all Stop Facebook from sharing your data with friend's apps. Here's how For Facebook users, if you haven't used an app in three months, the company will automatically remove its access to your data. When you sign into apps, you'll also give developers less of your personal information -- only your name, email and Facebook profile photo. The company will also start presenting you with a tool at the top of your news feeds that shows what apps you've been using so you can more easily manage your data settings.   Find out what Facebook knows about you and take action  In addition, the social media giant plans to audit any app it suspects of suspicious behavior. If developers don't agree to the audit, they'll be banned from the platform. Developers will also have to sign a contract in order to ask people for access to their data.  "Facebook's proposals are a good start, but they don't go far enough," Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said in a statement. "They've already shown us that we can't trust them. We need real transparency and accountability." Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, also called the changes a "start" but said Zuckerberg still needs to testify before Congress. "Facebook should show good faith & support the Honest Ads Act," she tweeted on Wednesday . "To truly regain the public's trust, Facebook must make significant changes so this doesn't happen again." "Mea culpas are no substitute for questions and answers under oath," Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Judiciary Committee,  told Bloomberg News. "Congress has failed to hold Facebook accountable and legislate protections on privacy, which are manifestly necessary." Still, this may be a new day for Zuckerberg -- at least in terms of his accessibility to those seeking answers about how the social network behaves. "There's an element of accountability where I should be out there doing more interviews," he told CNN.  "Over the course of Facebook, I've made all kinds of different mistakes, whether that's technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes. We've launched product after product that didn't work," Zuckerberg said in his interview with the New York Times. "I don't know that it's possible to know every issue that you're going to face down the road," he continued. "But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up, and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them."

By Ben Grubb Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size As social networking giant Facebook and "big data" firm Cambridge Analytica find themselves at the centre of a privacy scandal involving the election of US President Donald Trump, the question must be asked: is time up for companies that bury important privacy info in long and baffling terms of service, and then claim that users are agreeing to give their lives away by clicking yes? If you haven't caught up on the whole kerfuffle, this is what transpired: approximately 270,000 people installed a Facebook "personality quiz" app that connected to their account and sucked up not only their detailed personal information, such as Facebook likes, but also the personal information of their Facebook friends. Cambridge Analytica collected the personal Facebook information of more than 50 million users; way more than the number of people who installed the quiz. Facebook CEO has said the company will make changes, but do they go far enough? The "techlash" appears to be in full-swing, with #deletefacebook trending and even the founder of WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook for $US19 billion , suggesting that users delete their Facebook profiles . The answer to "at what cost?" has finally been provided; the cost of your personal information being divulged by Facebook to a third-party — without you truly consensenting to it — and it then being used by firms such as Cambridge Analytica and their various clients to perform so-called data-driven behavioural change, or manipulation of your beliefs through data mining. Laughably, Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, claimed that Facebook users "knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked". Advertisement He also said that "everyone involved gave their consent". Anna Johnston, director of privacy consultancy Salinger Privacy and a former NSW deputy privacy commissioner, told me she hoped and believed that the Facebook scandal would force technology companies to start putting their users, rather than advertisers and marketers, first. "I actually think", Johnston said, "that we are about to enter a new age in which consumers, regulators and legislators will start to call out the practices of companies like Facebook which claim to rely on 'consent' … as based on an absurd legal fiction which can no longer stand. "It is not only utterly ridiculous to suggest that the [Cambridge Analytica] app users' millions of friends consented to any of this; I doubt many of the 270,000 gave a valid consent in the legal sense of it being voluntary, informed, and specific," Ms Johnston continued. "Having one line in the standard Facebook T&Cs; which says that by signing up to Facebook users are 'consenting' to the use and disclosure of their data 'for research' makes a mockery of the law of consent, as well as established ethical rules regarding research activities." Ms Johnston added that, on face value, Facebook's business practices did not, in her view, comply with existing Australian or European privacy laws when it came to consent. Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation was only going to reinforce this point, Ms Johnston said, "and arm regulators with massive fines to finally prove their point". Liam Pomfret, spokesman for the Australian Privacy Foundation , said the idea of consent was key to social online services, but that it had "been consistently undermined". "While privacy is often mis-characterised as an individual responsibility, this episode demonstrates how our privacy can be harmed by the behaviours and choices of those around us," he said. Mr Pomfret added that Australia's privacy legislators were "understaffed and underfunded", with the fines they could levy for privacy harms being "barely a slap on the wrist for multinationals". "These organisations must be properly supported by government, so they can be effective public interest watchdogs over these data-addicted firms," he said. "Long term, I personally hope that social networking sites will transition to new, more socially and commercially sustainable business models, adopting consumer privacy as a matter of corporate social responsibility." As Zeynep Tufekc, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, wrote in a New York Times opinion article : "Despite Facebook's claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her 'consent' — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word." Replay While the users involved in the personality quiz did indeed authorise their information to be disclosed, as well as their friends' information, their friends did not explicitly consent to it. And therein lies the main lesson which can be learned from this whole sorry saga: informed consent is crucial. Pointing to a 100-page long privacy policy is not enough, which is something the now outgoing Australian privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, has been banging on about for some time now, ever since he analysed mobile apps in 2013 and found they weren't doing enough to get informed consent. "It's important to get informed consent from people so they can decide whether or not to install an app," Mr Pilgrim said at the time . "Informed consent requires that users be told about the privacy implications of an app in a way they can understand." Facebook's response to the latest privacy incident seems to be creating yet another privacy dashboard, along with a few tweaks to its platform, such as restricting third-party developers' data access "even further to prevent other kinds of abuse". "We want to make sure you understand which apps you've allowed to access your data," Facebook chief Mr Zuckerberg said in a statement on Thursday . "In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data." Ah, the Facebook safety dinosaur. She'll keep our data secure. Further, he said Facebook would remove third-party developers' access to your data if you hadn't used their app in three months. Facebook would also "reduce" by default the data you give an app when you sign in to only your name, profile photo, and email address. But, he said Facebook would still allow some developers to get access to users' posts "or other private data", but only if the developers signed a contract with Facebook over its use. But is this enough? Yet another dashboard (or an extension of it) featuring Dino the blue Facebook privacy dinosaur, ready to fix all your privacy issues, only after you've realised how much you've disclosed. As Tufekc points out, a business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to "opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling" will inevitably be misused. "The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability," Tufekc wrote. And how do we fix that? At this point it's only going to be through government-enforced legislation, or behavioural change by users of social media networks saying, "No, I'm not going to sign up to this".

Your MP knows more about you than ASIO By Jack Waterford Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size A month ago, a central item of Australian political conversation involved the claim of politicians – Barnaby Joyce in particular – to a right of privacy from the media and the public over matters in their private lives. Now we are talking about the public's right of privacy from the politicians and their party organisations. Both debates are more than a little bit late, and a good deal of the pontificating anyway misses much of the point. The founder of Facebook seems to be admitting that there was some mistake or misfeasance, whether by Facebook itself, or by Cambridge Analytica, a company specialising in mining personal data for political purposes. Cambridge used data to help the Trump organisation focus propaganda to about 50 million Americans. Suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica Alexander Nix leaves the offices in central London on Tuesday, March 20. Photo: Dominic Lipinski A good deal of the expressed public concern, even by regulators such as privacy commissioners and consumer commissioners, seems to express surprise that this sort of thing could go on, or does. But, as any number of more sober commentators, perhaps most effectively Bernard Keane of Crikey.com has pointed out, what has been happening falls right in the middle of the business model being used by Google, Facebook, and any number of other internet and social media enterprises to make money. These companies are worth billions, and make billions, precisely because they mine information from what their "customers" – clients, members, users, consumers – voluntarily tell them. They then sell this information to people wanting access to what they find out. They have almost destroyed the old business model of conventional "old media" – newspapers, radio and television—because the market thinks they are better at delivering buyers. Advertisement These companies provide platforms by which ordinary consumers can communicate with each other, ask questions, buy goods and services, and express opinions. The companies monitor the traffic generated, including the networks of contacts that individual consumers have, for what it says about what sorts of goods they are interested in, what they like and do not like, and how they interact with each other. Those who specialise in this sort of analysis, and the algorithms they devise, can tell quite a lot from a pattern of Facebook entries, from the types of friends one has, the other sites visited, the inquiries and searches made for particular types of information, the sorts of clickbait clicked, and the types of quizzes entered. Analysis about the sort of person you are can be very sophisticated. But much is common sense, given clues we leave about, wittingly or otherwise. As the debate about permitting police and intelligence agencies to monitor computer use to combat terrorism and crime demonstrated, one can make deductions from far more than openly expressed opinions or statements of fact. One can also make deductions from the meta-data (information about sites visited, friendship and contact networks, the sorts of sites from which people obtain news and information, or opinion and analysis, and the types of media consumed). In a politically polarised society such as the US, where many in one side in politics scarcely know, let alone mix with, or share information sources with people of the other side, mere information about political orientation may not be especially valuable. But information about which types of issues are mobilising voters, about trigger points, about the intensity with which opinions are held, and about whether voters are minded to vote is much more useful. Some don't seem to realise that they have freely given the information being used to identify them as potential travellers on an airline, purchasers of a type of car, or customers for particular brands of deodorant. No doubt they think everyone gets much the same sort of product promotion. They may dimly recall that their joining a particular medium, or using a particular type of search engine, involved ticking a box which acknowledged that such information could be used. But they have very little idea of how sophisticated the use of such data might be, and how skilfully advertisers could use it to target particular types of customer, and to focus different types of customers with messages catering to particular types of need, emotions or attitudes to the product. That genie has long been out of the bottle. We are at the point where anyone who expressed surprise could only be described as naïve, or of having been asleep for a long time. Some might not vehemently object to the cunning of internet advertisers in pushing travel products, intimate apparel or soap. But they suddenly become uneasy when they realise that it is being used to shape political opinions, or to surveil and categorise people by their beliefs, instincts and prejudices. Somehow, it is alright to do this in commerce, or, perhaps, to detect any terrorists. But, they fear, it is wrong or unsporting to be collecting such information about civilians in general, or to be using it to shape opinions or votes. Or, if it must occur, it should be subject to greater controls, and far greater accountability. Certainly everyone has been tut-tutting about the boasting of Cambridge Analytica executives that their analysis helped elect Donald Trump, by delivering critical votes in critical places through advertisements carefully designed to cater for particular emotions, beliefs and feelings. Advertisements they were able to devise by some sort of Facebook data-mining which, according to the reportage and commentaries, has been somewhat improper, illicit or beyond whatever Facebook had licensed. It has been said that Cambridge Analytica has been looking for Australian customers willing to pay for access to its algorithms. These might not, of course, be from a political party. They could be iron ore miners seeking to kill off a proposed resource rent tax, a business group seeking lower company tax rates, or a pensioner lobby seeking greater benefits. They might even be academics wondering about what factors combined to set opinions, beliefs and emotions on a particular issue, and how "hot" it was in determining political allegiances. Cambridge was able to parlay its information from an initially small group of people extensively studied into much wider conclusions from drawing in their networks and "friends," into an ultimate 50 million Facebook users. Perhaps an academic might want to study, via Facebook analysis, how opinions were formed or altered by discussions with family, friends, neighbours, and informal and formal sources of information, including mainstream media and social media. [Security officers monitoring subversive ideas, and cops investigating criminal conspiracies, have much the same sorts of interest, if about different motivators.] The truth is, of course, that major political parties have been doing close surveillance of individual Australian voters for quite some time. Cambridge is probably exaggerating its role and its success, but such surveillance works. The big parties use proprietary software to add to basic information provided by electoral rolls. They get extra demographic information, broken into small zones, from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Other information about education, employment status, employment sector, approximate income, household assets, and the make-up of the family, are fairly readily obtainable in this day and age. This can be supplemented with information, and contact details, gathered by members and party officials, tame telephone polling at which guileless people (thinking themselves to be responding anonymously) answer questions about their previous and future voting intentions, the issues they care about, and their feelings about political leaders. More is garnered from participation in public events, from party door-knocking, and responses to invitations for participation in different types of event. They probably amalgamate with it information and intelligence gathered from associated entities, such as trade unions, and from their own campaigns. There is also some readily accessible information (obtainable, inter alia from politicians' electoral offices without misusing access to the data files of government agencies) about the receipt of benefits, grants and subsidies. No good or bad turn done to a voter goes unrecorded. To this is added very sophisticated polling data gathered by experienced and very professional pollsters employed by the various parties. These have long been practised at shaping messages, and road-testing the forms they take, as well as in devising different forms of the message for particular audiences. The messages sent out, even in conventional media or in mail outs, robo-phonecalls, or blitzes in particular areas, are strategised for what is known about the audience for particular messages, and for the capacity of particular messages to settle or unsettle voting intentions. Sometimes the messages come in stages, by which voters are gently detached from previously firmly held opinions to a more neutral position, than lured into a new view more favourable to a particularly party. The end-up point is that the average MP knows more about you than ASIO, the cops, or Woolworths. And any piece of knowledge she or he can exploit, will be exploited. Not necessarily successfully, of course, just as we don't buy all of the goodies on offer to us. Many of us are so inured to a barrage of messages that nothing penetrates. We do not know how much the parties are using data gleaned from Facebook or other social media, in major part because the parties simply will not say. They have already exempted themselves from any disclosure obligations under the Privacy Act. They are under no general duty – as others in government or commerce are – to use information only for the purposes for which it was obtained and for which permission was given. Although almost all of the work of political parties is funded by the taxpayer – whether through general grants or pooled allowances paid to parliamentarians – the parties are not public bodies. Nor are they subject to the scrutiny or inspection of the privacy commissioner, or anyone else with a function or duty to investigate abuse. The law of Australia is advancing to the point where one can expect the discovery of some sort of constitutional "right" to privacy almost any day now. But we are not there yet. And when we do get close, one can expect that the big political machines will yet again exempt themselves from its operation, with much the same bipartisan spirit with which they agree on political salary increases. I should be very surprised, frankly, if much of the data obtained from Cambridge algorithms, or the type of data mining being used on social media, was much more sophisticated than that already in use here. Australia has compulsory voting; many of the democracies with which we compare ourselves have voluntary voting, and struggle to get 50 or 60 per cent participating in an election. Overseas, as much, or more, energy is focused on motivating people to bestir themselves to vote as in urging them to vote for a particular party or candidate. Here, most people will vote, and messages are tailored accordingly. There is still an intensive focus on getting messages that work, and on neutralising messages from the other side. But, I suspect, the operatives here are generally surer about the motivators which will win best, or lose worst. That is not to say that political messages are more sophisticated, or less focused on the emotional or the visceral. Indeed I think that the quality of the sloganising, dumbed down monolithic messages, and appeals to the heart and head of voters deteriorates by the election. And mass communications – and perhaps the much-dreaded "mainstream media" is in any event alert for nuance, different statements to different audiences, and different stresses and priorities in different regions, to blunt some of the efforts to press each individual's vote in an individual way. Is it all too late? Do Australians care that Facebook has helped make them an open book? Did its utility, or vanity, blind us to the risks? Did panic mongering about the threats of terrorism, or refugees, drug syndicates or paedophiles soften us up for routine invasion of our most intimate secrets, relationships, and thoughts? In any event, would it be impossible now to impose controls and limits, or to hold potential abusers to account, because of the way that globalisation and communications have rendered irrelevant the national borders supposedly being protected by Peter Dutton? These have been questions canvassed last year by Professor Genevieve Bell, of the ANU, in her Boyer lectures, and by many other observers. My own view is that the public has as yet no urgent view about what has been given away and how vulnerable it is. We could retreat, but not back to where we were before the computer, before the internet and before the genius of platforms such as Facebook. But I cannot see the present crop of major party politicians convincingly whipping up much indignation, or creating the circumstances by which better balances are set. This is one for consumer action, and going over the heads of politicians. Perhaps through social media, or Twitter? Jack Waterford is a former editor of The Canberra Times .

Labour and National talk to real people, steer clear of Cambridge Analytica-style data services 23 Mar, 2018 3:43pm 3 minutes to read Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook, has apologised for the "breach of trust" over Cambridge Analytica's use of 50 million Facebook users' personal data. Photo / Bloomberg          Neither Labour or National say they used data services like those of Cambridge Analytica - the company embroiled in controversy over its use of 50 million Facebook users' data - in their 2017 election campaigns. A spokeswoman for Phil Twyford, who was Labour's election campaign chairman, said Labour did not use any data analytical company, while a National spokesman said the party didn't use Cambridge Analytica, and didn't intend to. Cambridge Analytica has been under pressure over its use of 50 million Facebook users' personal data to build sophisticated profiles, which were then used to target voters in the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Yesterday Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg apologised for the "breach of trust" and vowed that Facebook will do better to protect user privacy. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. President Trump appeared to brag about using Cambridge Analytica on Twitter: "Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore!" Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018 Labour and National both made use of software company NationBuilder for website platforms, such as for fundraising and volunteering. NationBuilder was used in both the Remain campaign in the Brexit vote and in Trump's campaign. But Labour Party general secretary Andrew Kirton said the party did not use Cambridge Analytica or any other external company to crunch its numbers. "It's overrated and our focus is on real conversations with voters on the doorstep and on the phone." He said the party used data from sources such as the Census to guess, for example, who was a student and therefore potentially interested in receiving information on its tertiary fees-free policy. A National Party spokesman said National developed its messaging strategy internally. "While digital tools are useful, we have found that nothing is as effective as traditional campaign methods of actually getting out and talking with New Zealanders, listening to their aspirations and concerns in person. "We have used contractors to assist with some content creation and administrative tasks associated with running engaging social media channels. " The spokesman said the party used Facebook to help maximise its advertising and to target supporters, similar to buying radio or television advertising based on ratings and demographics. "Targeting tools are helpful to deliver value for money. For example - targeting relevant messages or policy to people who 'like' our Facebook pages, young voters, senior voters, or voters in a particular location." He said Crosby Textor, which the party has used in previous campaigns, was involved for some polling and research. The Warehouse Group confirmed earlier this week that it had used Cambridge Analytica services for market research, but a spokesperson said local customer data was not at risk. Parliament will next week consider the Privacy Bill , which will introduce mandatory reporting of harmful data breaches, and bring in new offences with penalties up to $10,000. But the bill omits the Privacy Commissioner's recommendation to penalise companies up to $1 million, or individuals up to $100,000, for harmful breaches of privacy. In the bill's current form, if millions of New Zealand Facebook users' data was breached in a harmful way, the Privacy Commissioner would be mostly powerless to penalise the company as long as Facebook reported the breach. The commissioner could only fine the company $10,000 as part of a compliance order to fix the problem. Justice Minister Andrew Little said he expected the bill to be improved after Select Committee scrutiny.

Kate Hawkesby: Facebook scandal a slap in the face for users 23 Mar, 2018 6:46am 3 minutes to read  Video will play in    Facebook is facing a global firestorm after reports a data research firm connected to the 2017 trump campaign illicitly harvested personal data from 50 million users.           Well how important is your privacy to you? And if it's breached, how long should you wait to hear from the people who breached it? Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg broke five long days of silence yesterday to admit mistakes over the Cambridge Analytica scandal - he's known about it for ages of course but waited for the story to break before responding - and to outline steps to protect user data going forward. But is it too little too late? Well it surely is for the 50 million Facebook users whose data has already been mined and used. Zuckerberg stopped short of apologising - and some would argue removed himself from taking any responsibility by referring to the scandal as something that "happened" rather than anything Facebook "did". Advertisement Advertise with NZME. One critic, a chairman of a crisis management company, gave Zuckerberg a B- grade for his response. Too little, too late. So where does this leave us here in New Zealand? Well the Cambridge Analytica nightmare has prompted investigations in Britain, Canada and the US. Australia, as of last month, updated its legislation around data breaches so as to hold companies more accountable. But what's happening here? Well despite New Zealanders' historically very trusting online behaviour, we actually have very little protection. There are privacy laws which may cover bits and pieces, but in terms of actual cut and thrust legislation to hold companies holding our information to account, we don't have any. Not yet. Pressure is of course mounting, and laws will be coming - but when? And in the meantime, how safe is our information online? It seems sad that despite living in the internet age and raising a generation who'll never know a life outside of Google and the worldwide web, we have to wait for a scandal to hit before adequately regulating and protecting ourselves. To assume the best of companies, and to expect our online information to be safe is I suppose a basic expectation, but it's possibly also naive and unrealistic. Even with good intent, some companies can't, or don't know how to, fully protect that information from being harvested. Smaller companies in particular would likely struggle. But all of those reasons are not enough to stop NZ from legislating some protection. It may not stop it happening here, but it would certainly hold companies to account and help them stay focused on data protection. In the meantime, whether it has a chilling effect on how much we share online remains to be seen. But I'd like to think that instead of waiting for a similar scandal to hit us, we can now proactively regulate some way of giving online users the basic respect they deserve - a right to privacy.

News World 0 Mark Zuckerberg's media rounds did little to satisfy Washington lawmakers who have demanded this week that the billionaire testify before Congress. Photo: Getty Images Facebook is under more pressure from lawmakers, investors, advertisers and users, a day after chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted the social media network made mistakes in letting 50 million users' data get into the hands of political a consultancy. break US lawmakers demanded Zuckerberg personally testify in Washington to explain his company's actions. Meanwhile, advertisers Mozilla and Commerzbank suspended ads on the service and the hashtag #DeleteFacebook remained popular online, although it was hard to tell how many users are abandoning Facebook. In light of those concerns, investors continued to sell off Facebook shares. The company has lost more than $US50 billion ($NZ69 million) in market value since allegations this week that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters and influence the 2016 presidential election. Five days after the scandal broke, Zuckerberg apologised on Wednesday for mistakes his company made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to improve privacy protection. On Thursday, Facebook executives were still saying sorry. “It was a mistake,” Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships at Facebook, said at The Financial Times FT Future of News Conference in New York City. Zuckerberg's apology and promises were not enough to ease political pressure on the world's largest social media company. "It shouldn't be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data. Those rules should be set by society as a whole and so by parliament," British minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, told BBC Radio. Zuckerberg's media rounds did little to satisfy Washington lawmakers in either political party who have demanded this week that the billionaire testify before Congress. The Republican chairman and top Democrat of the US House Energy and Commerce Committee said they will in coming days formally ask Zuckerberg to testify. The request came a day after company executives briefed committee aides for nearly two hours and left with a list of at least 60 questions they were unable to answer, according to two aides. Zuckerberg said in media interviews on Thursday he would be willing to testify if he is the right person at the company to speak to lawmakers. “My message to Mark Zuckerberg is you are right person. There’s no question you are the right person,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told reporters after Facebook executives briefed Senate staff on Thursday. Facebook said it had no further comment beyond what Zuckerberg had already said. Facebook executives also briefed another House committee on Thursday, and while they answered many questions about Cambridge Analytica they were unprepared to address broader questions about Facebook’s data privacy policies, according to a staffer who was present REPUTATIONAL COSTS Wall Street analysts expressed relief that there were no signs so far of a more fundamental shift in the company's advertising-driven revenue model, but some said there would be costs to shore up its reputation. Facebook, with more than 2 billion monthly active users, made almost all its $US40.6 billion in revenue last year from advertising. Several analysts cut price targets and Facebook shares were down 2.2% on Thursday in heavy trading. Technology stocks have fallen along with Facebook this week as investors worried about tighter scrutiny of global platforms like Alphabet's Google, Twitter and Snapchat. Analysts said that Zuckerberg's promises to investigate thousands of apps, and to give members a tool that lets them turn off access, would not substantially reduce advertisers' ability to use Facebook data - the company's lifeblood. Nevertheless, open-source browser and app developer Mozilla said it was "pressing pause" on its Facebook advertising after the revelations prompted it to take a closer look at the site's default privacy settings. "We found that its current default settings leave access open to a lot of data - particularly with respect to settings for third-party apps," Mozilla said in a blog post. Commerzbank paused its campaign on Facebook. "Brand safety and data security are very important to us," head of brand strategy Uwe Hellmann told newspaper Handelsblatt. The comments were confirmed by a spokesman for the bank. British advertising group ISBA, which represents thousands of brands, threatened to withdraw ads if investigations show user data has been misused. "We think this issue is more likely to snowball than recede and that advertisers are reaching a tipping point at which spending on not only Facebook and other online platforms, is re-evaluated," brokerage Liberum said in a note. But Sharon Rowlands, president of USA Today Network Marketing Solutions, said it was unlikely a flood of brands would stop advertising on Facebook because it is good at targeting their customers and generating a return on investment. "The challenge is that the platform performs," Rowlands said.

By       The evolution of Zuckerberg apologies. Photo illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photos by Robert Galbraith/Reuters (2), Stephen Lam/Reuters.  Future Tense is a partnership of Slate , New America , and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.  After five days of mounting outrage over the revelation that a strategic communication firm used pilfered Facebook data to target voters, many were wondering why Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg hadn’t issued a statement . Finally, Wednesday afternoon, at a moment when many users were contemplating whether to # deletefacebook , Zuckerberg released a post on his Facebook page , followed later in the evening by a two-part interview on CNN that repeated much of the same content.  Zuckerberg’s statement addresses “the Cambridge Analytica situation.” In it, he offers a defense of the Facebook’s actions and promises change . He also provides a timeline of the event, detailing when a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app, deployed it on Facebook, collected data from millions of users, and then later shared the dataset with Cambridge Analytica. Zuckerberg outlines steps Facebook has already taken to mitigate this kind of behavior and the steps they will take moving forward. He closes with an earnest personal narrative about how seriously he takes this matter.   The post follows a pattern visible across a decade and a half of Zuckerberg mea culpas that have followed:  • the 2006 user uproar over the introduction of the News Feed ; • the 2007 outrage over Facebook allowing user profiles to be discoverable by search engines ; • the 2008 complaints about Facebook’s practice of indefinitely keeping copies of user data from deleted accounts ; • the 2008 backlash when the “Beacon” program was introduced ; • the 2009 user indignation about expansions to Facebook’s user data retention policies ; • the 2010 concern over the way Facebook was handling privacy and was divulging identifying information to advertisers; • the 2010 worry that Facebook was “breaking things” ; • the 2015 critique that Facebook was acting in an anti-competitive manner in introducing a “Free Basics” program in India ; • and more recently, in responses over Facebook’s influence on the 2016 U.S. elections and other global elections .   I know this pattern because of my work on the Zuckerberg Files . Along with Anna Lauren Hoffmann at the University of Washington and Michael Zimmer at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, I researched and analyzed nearly every single thing that Mark Zuckerberg ever said in public from 2004–2014 . The pattern I’ve observed goes like this: Acknowledge, diffuse blame, make the problem manageable, empower users, invoke personal care.   Step 1. Acknowledge  Typically, Zuckerberg situates Facebook as attentive to users’ concerns, but positions whatever critique is being made within the context of an ever-changing Facebook. Credit where credit is due, he has gotten a lot better at this step since his 2006 post, “ Calm down. Breathe. We hear you ,” which came in response to user outrage over the introduction of the news feed system that broadcast profile changes to other users. In that case, his tone was outright dismissive of the issue.  This is how it shook out Wednesday: We have a responsibility to protect your data. … I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn’t happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago.  In these opening lines, Zuckerberg lets the public know that he, personally, is responsive to their cries. The next step is selectively avoiding responsibility.  Step 2. Diffuse blame  Avoiding blame is something that Zuckerberg does well. He has sometimes dodged it by suggesting outraged users are part of a feedback mechanism that feeds the evolution of the platform . However, in this case, he has a readymade patsy in researcher Aleksandr Kogan (who he mentions nine times by name in the 900-word post) and Cambridge Analytica, stating, “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook.” Zuckerberg’s tone is almost congratulatory toward his own company for having the foresight to change its policies in 2014, “to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way.”  While moving blame, Zuckerberg positions himself individually (as opposed to Facebook as a whole) as an agent for positive change. For example, he writes in his latest post (emphasis mine): I’ve been working to understand exactly what happened I’m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community.  At the same time, when he does finally cop to some blame, he does so by shifting the onus for previous undesirable outcomes onto the institution as a whole.  We have a responsibility to protect your data. … But we also made mistakes, there’s more to do. …  Step 3. Make the problem manageable  When Zuckerberg’s faced blowback, one of the things his responses do is frame the problem so that it appears manageable through platform redesign or policy response. For example, in a 2010 Washington Post op-ed responding to the way the company handled privacy , Zuckerberg wrote, “Sometimes we move too fast—and after listening to recent concerns, we’re responding.” In Wednesday’s post, Zuckerberg does it again, stating, In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people’s information in this way. But there’s more we need to do and I’ll outline those steps here. …  By making the problem appear addressable through these changes, he simultaneously makes the issue not about Facebook’s economic model itself. Problems no longer become fundamentally about Facebook building profiles of individuals against which advertisements are sold ( which some have argued actually is the problem in this case ), but instead become a function of design.  Step 4. Empower users  In Zuckerberg’s rhetoric, new tools that empower users are the panacea solution to what ails Facebook. New tools were the response to the sudden threat of search engine visibility in 2007 , and of overcomplexity of already existing privacy tools in 2010 . These tools reposition users as having control . We can see this same rhetorical device deployed in his Wednesday post:  [W]e want to make sure you understand which apps you’ve allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you’ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps’ permissions to your data.  Of course, what this statement doesn’t address is why it took this event for Facebook to make privacy tools more centrally located.  Step 5. Invoke personal care.  Finally, Zuckerberg tends to conclude his responses to controversy with a reminder of how much he cares. For example, responding to the 2006 controversy over the introduction of profile changes alerting news feeds, he wrote, “This may sound silly, but I want to thank all of you who have written in and created groups and protested. Even though I wish I hadn’t made so many of you angry, I am glad we got to hear you.” This same note is hit in the closing remarks of Wednesday’s statement: I’m serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. … I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together. I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we’d like, but I promise you we’ll work through this and build a better service over the long term.  This passage is doing a lot of work, but I want to draw attention to one thing in particular. It pushes the idea that he (Zuckerberg, not regulators) will be the instigator to save Facebook, (though in the CNN interview, he did mention being open to certain forms of industrywide regulation). And it presupposes that he actually has the power to do so. This is important because, if users or investors lose faith in Zuckerberg’s ability to create change, they lose faith in Facebook .  So should we put faith in Zuckerberg’s mea culpa this time? To answer that question, let’s return to what Zuckerberg wrote in his 2010 Washington Post op-ed. He told us the five principles under which Facebook operates:  1) You have control over how your information is shared.   2) We do not share your personal information with people or services you don’t want.  3) We do not give advertisers access to your personal information.  4) We do not and never will sell any of your information to anyone.  5) We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.  We need to see this most recent mea culpa for what it is. Not just a formula for crisis response, but the pattern of a tech leader who cannot publicly reckon with the fact that his company and its sprawling, unchecked third-party information ecosystem rotted away those first three principles.

Interested in Add Interest The Republican-authored report, the first to be released from any congressional committee conducting a Russia investigation, now heads to the intelligence community for declassification, a process that could take weeks. “Today, we are one step closer to delivering answers to the questions the American people have been asking for over a year,” Rep. Mike Conaway , R-Texas, the top Republican leading the Russian probe, said in a statement. Senators warn of 'urgent' threat to US elections Democrats, who will submit their own minority rebuttal for release alongside the GOP -authored report, argue that Republicans prematurely shut down the investigation under political pressure, and refused to follow important and unresolved leads. Saying Thursday’s vote ended a “rather sad chapter” in the traditionally bipartisan committee’s history, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the committee, called the GOP report a “fundamentally unserious effort.” “It was clear that their report was going to be completely political from beginning to end and there wasn't much to work on in a joint fashion,” he said. While Democrats did not sign on to the report, some of its findings appear to be in line with sentiments the minority has previously expressed - including the conclusion that the Executive Branch's post-election response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election was "insufficient." Some of the recommendations regarding election and cyber-security also echo the bipartisan recommendations on election security issued by the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this week. Read more here “A lot of the report says stuff that we all know and we all agree with,” Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said. “It has a number of conclusions and findings with which we disagree.” Republicans also dismissed allegations of wrongdoing during the campaign by Trump associates and family members, including Donald Trump Jr., who met with a Russian lawyer who promised information on Hillary Clinton in June of 2016, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has faced questions about meeting with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the campaign and subsequent testimony to Congress about his and the Trump campaign's communications with Russian officials. In their report, Republicans said they found no evidence of collusion related to Trump’s “pre-campaign business dealings” - a subject Democrats have wanted to scrutinize more closely. Republicans also concluded that Trump associates had repeated “ill-advised” contacts with WikiLeaks , but argued that possible Russian efforts to set up a backchannel with the Trump camp after the election “suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign.” Their report describes the sourcing of the information in the infamous dossier written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. Steele was employed by opposition research firm Fusion GPS that was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign. It is unclear whether the report will include an assessment of that information. Republicans also determined that leaks of classified information since the election “have damaged national security and potentially endangered lives,” and accused former Obama administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper of providing “inconsistent testimony” to the committee about his contacts with the media. They have recommended that Congress pass legislation to increase the penalties for unauthorized disclosures of classified information and that the Executive Branch institute polygraphs for all non-confirmed political appointees with top secret clearance. The report also calls on Congress to consider repealing the Logan Act, the 18th-century law that forbids private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. Conaway and committee Republicans initially said their report disagreed with the assessment from top intelligence officials that Russian President Vladimir Putin preferred Trump to win the election over Hillary Clinton. That finding, which some Republicans on the committee disputed, was not included in the summary of findings released Thursday, though Republicans said the intelligence community “did not employ proper analytical tradecraft” regarding Putin’s “strategic intentions.” Democrats offered motions to subpoena more than a dozen witnesses and entities to compel additional testimony, documents, and information, including outgoing White House communications director Hope Hicks , Sessions and Deutsche Bank. Republicans opposed the moves, Schiff said, adding that Democrats plan to push the committee to release witness interview transcripts. The votes in committee broke down along party lines, with Democrats opposing the release of the report and Republicans opposing Democrats’ motions, save for Rep. Trey Gowdy's "present" vote on Democrats' motion to hold former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer the committee’s questions while under subpoena, according to a source in the business meeting. Democrats plan to continue investigating unilaterally, amid reports that a data firm tied to the Trump campaign improperly collected data from millions of Facebook profiles without permission. They are planning to interview Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee who has alleged wrongdoing at the company and could release their own minority report sometime before the midterm elections. Republicans, who have signaled that they will not join additional interviews, have accused Democrats of seeking to extend the probe for political purposes.

Composite: Guardian Design Team Before Facebook suspended Aleksandr Kogan from its platform for the data harvesting “ scam ” at the centre of the unfolding Cambridge Analytica scandal, the social media company enjoyed a close enough relationship with the researcher that it provided him with an anonymised, aggregate dataset of 57bn Facebook friendships. Facebook provided the dataset of “every friendship formed in 2011 in every country in the world at the national aggregate level” to Kogan’s University of Cambridge laboratory for a study on international friendships published in Personality and Individual Differences in 2015. Two Facebook employees were named as co-authors of the study, alongside researchers from Cambridge, Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley. Kogan was publishing under the name Aleksandr Spectre at the time. A University of Cambridge press release on the study’s publication noted that the paper was “the first output of ongoing research collaborations between Spectre’s lab in Cambridge and Facebook”. Facebook did not respond to queries about whether any other collaborations occurred. “The sheer volume of the 57bn friend pairs implies a pre-existing relationship,” said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “It’s not common for Facebook to share that kind of data. It suggests a trusted partnership between Aleksandr Kogan/Spectre and Facebook .” Facebook downplayed the significance of the dataset, which it said was shared with Kogan in 2013. “The data that was shared was literally numbers – numbers of how many friendships were made between pairs of countries – ie x number of friendships made between the US and UK,” Facebook spokeswoman Christine Chen said by email. “There was no personally identifiable information included in this data.” Facebook’s relationship with Kogan has since soured. “We ended our working relationship with Kogan altogether after we learned that he violated Facebook’s terms of service for his unrelated work as a Facebook app developer,” Chen said. Facebook has said that it learned of Kogan’s misuse of the data in December 2015, when the Guardian first reported that the data had been obtained by Cambridge Analytica. “We started to take steps to end the relationship right after the Guardian report, and after investigation we ended the relationship soon after, in 2016,” Chen said. On Friday 16 March, in anticipation of the Observer ’s reporting that Kogan had improperly harvested and shared the data of more than 50 million Americans , Facebook suspended Kogan from the platform, issued a statement saying that he “lied” to the company, and characterised his activities as “a scam – and a fraud”. On Tuesday, Facebook went further, saying in a statement: “The entire company is outraged we were deceived.” And on Wednesday, in his first public statement on the scandal, its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called Kogan’s actions a “breach of trust”. But Facebook has not explained how it came to have such a close relationship with Kogan that it was co-authoring research papers with him, nor why it took until this week – more than two years after the Guardian initially reported on Kogan’s data harvesting activities – for it to inform the users whose personal information was improperly shared. And Kogan has offered a defence of his actions in an interview with the BBC and an email to his Cambridge colleagues obtained by the Guardian. “My view is that I’m being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Kogan said on Radio 4 on Wednesday. The data collection that resulted in Kogan’s suspension by Facebook was undertaken by Global Science Research (GSR), a company he founded in May 2014 with another Cambridge researcher, Joseph Chancellor. Chancellor is currently employed by Facebook. Between June and August of that year, GSR paid approximately 270,000 individuals to use a Facebook questionnaire app that harvested data from their own Facebook profiles, as well as from their friends, resulting in a dataset of more than 50 million users. The data was subsequently given to Cambridge Analytica , in what Facebook has said was a violation of Kogan’s agreement to use the data solely for academic purposes. In his email to colleagues at Cambridge, Kogan said that he had created the Facebook app in 2013 for academic purposes, and used it for “a number of studies”. After he founded GSR, Kogan wrote, he transferred the app to the company and changed its name, logo, description, and terms and conditions. CNN first reported on the Cambridge email. Kogan did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on this article. “We made clear the app was for commercial use – we never mentioned academic research nor the University of Cambridge,” Kogan wrote. “We clearly stated that the users were granting us the right to use the data in broad scope, including selling and licensing the data. These changes were all made on the Facebook app platform and thus they had full ability to review the nature of the app and raise issues. Facebook at no point raised any concerns at all about any of these changes.” Kogan is not alone in criticising Facebook’s apparent efforts to place the blame on him. “In my view, it’s Facebook that did most of the sharing,” said Albright, who questioned why Facebook created a system for third parties to access so much personal information in the first place. That system “was designed to share their users’ data in meaningful ways in exchange for stock value”, he added. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Observer that Facebook was aware of the volume of data being pulled by Kogan’s app. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use,” Wylie said. “So they were like: ‘Fine.’” Play Video 13:04 Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video In the Cambridge email, Kogan characterised this claim as a “fabrication”, writing: “There was no exchange with Facebook about it, and ... we never claimed during the project that it was for academic research. In fact, we did our absolute best not to have the project have any entanglements with the university.” The collaboration between Kogan and Facebook researchers which resulted in the report published in 2015 also used data harvested by a Facebook app. The study analysed two datasets, the anonymous macro-level national set of 57bn friend pairs provided by Facebook and a smaller dataset collected by the Cambridge academics. 'They were given an inch and took 100 miles': readers on Cambridge Analytica, Facebook and privacy Read more For the smaller dataset, the research team used the same method of paying people to use a Facebook app that harvested data about the individuals and their friends. Facebook was not involved in this part of the study. The study notes that the users signed a consent form about the research and that “no deception was used”. The paper was published in late August 2015. In September 2015, Chancellor left GSR, according to company records. In November 2015, Chancellor was hired to work at Facebook as a user experience researcher. Neither Facebook nor Chancellor has responded to numerous queries about his knowledge of Kogan’s and GSR’s activities.

All rights reserved.         (Bhattacharya S et al. 2018) The Mystery of This Tiny "Alien" Skeleton Has Finally Been Solved Stranger than fiction.    The Atacama skeleton, or Ata, named after the Chilean desert where the remains were found, has 10 pairs of ribs. The average person has 12. Ata's skull narrows to a ridged peak.   Her bones are as calcified as those of a child between the ages of 6 and 8. Yet her skeleton's apparent age is at odds with her size. If Ata ever stood, she stood 6 inches high, barely tall enough to peek over a spring crocus. Her features attracted UFO hunters and extraterrestrial investigators, who suspected her bones might represent something remarkable. Ata is indeed remarkable. And she is human, according to the story told by her genes, which was published Thursday in the journal Genome Research . "We were able to look at all the mutations that were in this individual," said Stanford University geneticist Garry Nolan , an author of the new report. "And everybody is born with mutations. This person just happened to roll snake eyes." In 2013, Nolan revealed what he called a draft of her genome, which, though it had gaps, confirmed that Ata had human DNA . The new work presents her whole genome, including her unusual mutations. Ata's story started in northern Chile, one of the world's driest regions. The Atacama links Earth to the heavens. On its high plateau, NASA tests Mars rovers, driving them across parched terrain that role-plays as the Red Planet.   The sky rarely musters a cloud, giving a horde of giant telescopes an unblemished view of the stars at night. The desert is the future home of the world's largest optical telescope, named the European Extremely Large Telescope, and where construction began last year. And it was in this desert, near a church in an abandoned village , where a man reportedly found Ata's remains in 2003. The collector who now owns the skeleton purchased Ata from an archaeological black market, Nolan said. Ata's skeleton is kept in a secure location in Spain, according to Steven Greer, a retired emergency room physician who advocates for government disclosure of UFO sightings . Greer first met Ata's owner at a Spanish ufology conference in 2009. (People who study UFOs use the term ufology to make their pursuits sound more scientific.) The collector, after some persuading, allowed Greer to extract a small pip of bone marrow from one of her ribs. When Greer held Ata, he marveled at her size: She is so small her skeleton fit in the palm of his hand, he said. In 2013, Greer co-produced a documentary, " Sirius ," which unveiled Nolan's initial genetic research.   Nolan was not alone in his investigation. The Stanford scientist enlisted experts from a variety of fields, including specialists who study ancient DNA. Ata, though desiccated by the super-dry Atacama, is no ancient mummy. Over centuries, DNA breaks into fragments. But the genetic material in her body is too complete to be older than a few decades, he said. Nolan tapped Ralph Lachman , a pediatric radiologist at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, to analyze the skeleton's X-rays. The physician, Nolan said, is the "world's expert in bone disorders". Based on features such as growth around the bones' knuckles, the skeleton appears to be as developed as that of a 6-year-old's. But, to be clear, Lachman never argued Ata died in the midst of childhood, Nolan said. "He said the bones make it look like it's 6 years old," Nolan said. Comparing Ata's genome to the genomes of a chimpanzee and monkey ruled out a nonhuman origin. Her ancestors were South American, and most possibly Chilean. The scientists found no suggestion of a Y chromosome in her genetic package, confirming that she was female.   The new study uses a giant database of what Nolan called "phenotype-genetic correlations." An individual's phenotype is the collection of his or her characteristics, including height, eye color and earwax wetness . Genes, as well as the environment, influence a phenotype. Of her billions of nucleotides, which are the single bricks that make up her genes, the authors identified 3 million variations. This massive database is similar in concept to a social network mined by a research firm, Nolan said. If Cambridge Analytica collects enough of your likes and dislikes, it can predict your political preferences. Likewise, with enough genes, researchers can predict which individuals will have similar phenotypes. In many cases, Ata's genes matched individuals with bone disorders. She did not have an unusual number of mutations, Nolan said. What was exceptional was where they were concentrated. "This is a super rare human phenotype," said co-author Sanchita Bhattacharya, a bioinformatics researcher at the University of California at San Francisco. Ata is one of the rarest "we have ever observed, being only 6 inches and having this advanced bone age." USCF biomedicine professor Atul Butte, who created the database, said Ata had 64 unusual mutations linked to the skeletal system. Among these, the scientists found two variants new to the scientific literature that code for an abundant structural protein called collagen , as important to our bones as steel to a skyscraper. All told, the story in her genes is tragic. "Given multiple mutations identified in this specimen one could speculate it didn't survive long," Bhattacharya said, even if she was born alive. Given her origin, one could imagine, Nolan said, a distraught mother bringing her infant to a priest. "It was found, supposedly, in a house next to a church, which to me says rectory," he said. The body was positioned as if lying in state, arms to the side. "And then time goes by," he speculated, "and it gets forgotten or the priest dies." Nolan said he does not blame the owner for wanting to study Ata. After all, it took a team of 10 scientists five years to figure out what she is. Nor did he regret his study, and his investment of what he estimated to be $50,000 in funds and a quarter-million dollars' worth of time. "Now we know that there's something about this particular set of genes that leads to rapid bone growth," he said. He envisioned using this knowledge to influence stem cells and cartilage, healing bones quicker, and correctly. "To me, that's the beauty of basic science," he said. But, Nolan said, he hopes Ata's story ends in the place where it started: "Maybe this thing needs to be returned to Chile. Maybe it needs to be given the burial it deserves." 2018 © The Washington Post This article was originally published by The Washington Post .    More From ScienceAlert   The FDA Has Just Put The Brakes on a Major CRISPR Trial in Humans "Certain questions" need to be resolved. 3 hours ago     The Official Hunt For MH370 Is Over, Leaving The Mystery Unsolved An incredible search of the ocean floor revealed no trace of the aircraft. 3 hours ago     ScienceAlert Deal: This Service Uses Machine Learning to Find Your Perfect Wine Actually get a good bottle of wine. 4 hours ago     A Common Toothpaste Ingredient Has Been Linked to Gut Inflammation Check your labels for this ingredient. 4 hours ago     These Are The Most Common Mistakes We Make About Dog Happiness, According to Science Dogs are not people.  4 hours ago     A Blue Whale Has Been Spotted in The Red Sea For The First Time, And Scientists Can't Explain It We need to pay attention. 5 hours ago     Alien Life Could Thrive on The Moons of These 121 Exoplanets, Astronomers Say Who needs a whole planet anyway. 5 hours ago     Get ScienceAlert stories delivered to your inbox.

To be clear, this is a statement, not an apology, and it would sit better if Zuckerberg had added the words “to our advertisers and other third parties,” to the end of the sentence. What has been exposed here is not some unforceeable aberration, but an ordinary consequence of what Shoshana Zuboff calls “ surveillance capitalism ”. Cambridge Analytica scandal: the biggest revelations so far Read more Important things can happen in these rare moments when the mask slips and some of the world’s underlying machineries are exposed to wide critique and analysis. Facebook , its business model, and the web of commercial and political agreements holding it in place are currently undergoing such a moment of slippage. Big, positive changes are possible when events conspire to blow a scandal onto the front page day after day, if the moment of outrage is channeled in meaningful ways. As ever, this means a lot of well-paid people are scrambling right now to make sure that things change as little as possible, by making sure that we are collectively content to learn the wrong lessons and then go back to how we were. If this all dies down with a handful of executives forced to switch shell companies and an empty commitment by Facebook to work harder to earn our trust, the moment will have been wasted. Plenty has been written about the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica tie up which boiled over after the Guardian published a whistleblower’s account of how he’d helped build Cambridge Analytica “a full service propaganda machine” to microtarget potential Trump voters in the election campaign which saw Donald Trump win the White House in 2016. The sleazy way in which Cambridge Analytica was able to scrape Facebook’s vast collection of private information is not the real story here. Neither is the existence of these creepy little consultancies which promise to combine big data holdings with psychographic analysis to help political candidates manipulate voters. The real question is whether we are ready, collectively, to draw a line under surveillance capitalism itself, and start taking back a measure of control. The interests ranged against the public are huge. Corporate behemoths like Facebook and Google provide a free service in exchange for information about your most intimate personal, commercial, locational and political life, which they then sell to advertisers or other third parties. That’s the for-profit surveillance model: your inner life and purchasing habits are the product, packaged and on-sold. As you can imagine, political parties benefit hugely from data-driven micro-targeting. In Australia, political candidates are exempt from privacy law, and recent statements from the major parties indicate that’s not a privilege they are planning on giving up. Signals intelligence agencies acting within the Five Eyes network have built even greater data holdings under the US National Security Agency’s informal “collect it all” motto, material which places us all just a heartbeat away from “turn-key tyranny”, to borrow Edward Snowden’s memorable phrase. The common thread linking each of these layers is the non-consensual exploitation of private information that you might have had a reasonable expectation would be, well, private. It’s not just a simple case of opting out, either; even if you’re willing to give up Facebook’s near-ubiquitous “social graph”, the company also stands accused of amassing “shadow profiles’ of people who aren’t even signed up to Facebook. You also, as many have pointed out, will have a harder time opting out of government data collection. There are intermediate steps we can take right now, as long as we remember that that’s all they are. Bringing political parties under the remit of Australia’s mediocre privacy laws would be a start. Joining and supporting dedicated organisations like Digital Rights Watch and Electronic Frontiers Australia helps extend their reach and yours. Electronic Frontiers Foundation in the US just posted a how-to manual for deactivating the platform API sharing that underlies the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and Wired Magazine shared a plain-English guide to locking down all of Facebook’s privacy settings, in the event you decide you’re not yet ready to #deletefacebook altogether. All of these fall short in some important sense though, providing a measure of damage control amid a power landscape that remains deeply out of balance. Rather than trying to make surveillance capitalism a little fairer, we need to work at replacing it altogether. European developer and rights activist Aral Balkan lays out a set of proposals for replacement, founded on rejection of the idea that our most personal information is just a raw material to be mined, refined and transacted like any other commodity. He, and others like him, propose a return to individual data sovereignty. In a 2017 piece titled “ Encouraging individual sovereignty and a healthy commons ”, he points out: People have once again become property – albeit in digital, not biological, form. To counter this, we must build new infrastructure to enable people to regain individual sovereignty. Those aspects of the infrastructure that concern the world around us must belong to the commons and those parts that concern people … must be owned and controlled by individuals. Many pieces of this model already exist; there is already a developer community experimenting with tools that serve individuals rather than preying on them, with moves toward ubiquitous encryption in common messaging apps being one example. Australia's major parties defend privacy exemption over Cambridge Analytica Read more The question is whether we’re ready to exercise our data sovereignty, or whether we’re content to play passive victims while surveillance capitalism extends ever finer threads into every corner of our lives. For better or worse, a window is open in which to have that conversation, and it’s in all our interests that it stays open long after Facebook’s immediate woes have scrolled off the bottom of the newsfeed.

A number of the prime minister’s associates have been implicated in the case, including his personal lawyer and former top negotiator. Ganor was the former local representative of ThyssenKrupp and was suspected of giving bribes in connection to the purchase of submarines from the German company. He turned state’s witness in the case in July.  Liberman: Iran being pushed out of countries allied with Israel Avigdor Liberman returns to Israel from Africa and says Iran is being pushed out of countries with which Israel enjoys close ties. “It must be understand, in every country that has alliances and cooperation with us we are pushing Iran out and isolating it,” he tweets. Liberman says during his trip he discussed “cooperation on security matters, border defense, fighting terror and other issues” with the defense ministers and presidents of Rwanda, Zambia and Tanzania.  Kremlin: British FM’s comparison of Nazi Olympics to World Cup is ‘disgusting’ MOSCOW — The Kremlin denounces British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson’s statement comparing the World Cup in Russia to the Olympics hosted by Nazi Germany as “utterly disgusting.” The tough response marks an escalating war of words between Moscow and London over the poisoning in southwestern England of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent. Britain blamed the attack on Russia, which fiercely denied the accusations. Johnson agreed Wednesday with a Labour lawmaker who likened the soccer World Cup hosted by Russia this summer to Adolf Hitler’s use of the 1936 Olympics as propaganda for his regime. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov describes it Thursday as “the utterly disgusting statement which is unworthy of a foreign minister of any country.” He calls Johnson’s words “insulting and unacceptable.” — AP  Poll: Majority of Israelis think US embassy move will spark violence A majority of Israelis believe moving the US embassy to Jerusalem to mark Israel’s 70th anniversary will lead to renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians, a poll released Thursday says. While 61% of both Jews and Arabs say moving the embassy will lead to violence, 69% of Jews nevertheless say moving the embassy should not be put off, according to the monthly Peace Index of the Israel Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University. A vast majority (77.5%) of Arab Israelis, however, believe the embassy move should be delayed. Separately, 59% of Jews and 75% of Arabs say they don’t believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s denial of wrongdoing in a series of graft probes.  Abbas: Gaza Strip ‘kidnapped’ by Hamas Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas says the Gaza Strip has been “kidnapped” by Hamas. “Gaza is kidnapped by Hamas and the organization needs to hand it over to the Palestinian government,” Israel Radio quotes Abbas as saying at a press conference with Bulgaria’s president. Abbas also says the terror group must hand over security responsibility for the Strip or it will bear responsibility for the failure of Egyptian-backed mediation efforts between Hamas and Abbas’s Fatah party. Hamas has ruled Gaza for the past decade since taking over the coastal enclave from Fatah in a coup.

(AFP Photo/Abbas Momani)  Arab Israeli sentenced to 28 months for trying to join IS The Haifa District Court sentences an Arab Israeli man to 28 months in prison for trying to join the Islamic State terror group’s affiliate in the Sinai Peninsula. The verdict says Mohammed ben Ahmed Azzam, a 24-year-old resident of Kafr Manda in northern Israel, became interested in IS in 2015 and decided to join the terror group in 2016 “in order to help the organization’s members fight the State of Israel and liberate Jerusalem and the Al-Asqa Mosque from it.” Azzam’s sentence was agreed upon as part of a plea deal with prosecutors and will include time served since his arrest in June 2017.  Turkey: 3 soldiers killed clearing IEDs in Syrian Kurdish enclave ANKARA, Turkey — Three Turkish soldiers are killed Thursday clearing improvised explosive devices in the Syrian region of Afrin after the capture of Afrin city over the weekend, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim sys. “We have three martyrs today. They were martyred while clearing IEDs,” Yildirim says in a televised speech in Ankara. Three more soldiers are injured, the Turkish army adds. Turkish troops and allied Syrian forces seized control of Afrin city from the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia on Sunday. — AFP  Court orders release of woman who slapped prosecutor at soldier-slapper’s trial The Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court orders the conditional release of an Israeli woman arrested for slapping a military prosecutor at the trial of Palestinian teenager Ahed Tamimi, who was convicted of slapping and shoving a soldier. The court, however, delays the release in order to allow police to file an appeal. The woman, who was identified by police only as a resident of central Israel in her 40s, slapped the prosecutor during a hearing Wednesday at a West Bank military court, where Tamimi was sentenced to eight months in prison as part of a plea bargain for assaulting a soldier.  Police warn of traffic jams caused by ultra-Orthodox anti-draft protests Police warn the public of major traffic jams around Bnei Brak due to planned anti-conscription protests by ultra-Orthodox demonstrators. Police advise the public to use the Waze navigation app and to avoid traveling in the area. The protests, which are scheduled for this afternoon, were called by the so-called Jerusalem Faction, an ultra-Orthodox group fiercely opposed to the military enlistment of yeshiva students  Israel opens investigation into Facebook for Cambridge Analytica data breach Israel’s Justice Ministry has informed Facebook that it is opening an “administrative investigation” into the company following reports of the transfer of personal information from Facebook to data-mining firm Cambridge Analytics “and the possibility of additional violations of Israelis’ personal information,” the ministry says. Cambridge Analytica been under fire since The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that it used data inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections, including the 2016 US presidential election. Among that information were users’ likes. Additionally, a report by UK’s Channel 4 revealed hidden camera footage in which Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix describes using Israeli “intelligence gathering” to get information about voters. “According to privacy laws, personal information may only be used for the purpose it was given over for and may be transferred to another party only with consent,” a statement from the Justice Ministry’s Privacy Protection Authority statement says. “The Authority will therefore investigate whether personal information of Israeli users has been illegally used in a manner that violates their right to privacy and violates the laws of privacy protection in Israel,” the statement adds. Yesterday, breaking five days of silence, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized for the “major breach of trust,” admitted mistakes and outlined steps to protect user data. A spokesperson for the Justice Ministry confirms to the Times of Israel that the probe is not currently being treated as a criminal investigation, but says it may become one “at a later date.” — Raoul Wootliff  Rare, endangered primate born in Jerusalem zoo An Israeli zoo says an endangered primate known as a golden lion tamarin has been born in captivity. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo says the monkey was born two weeks ago to mom Bilbi and dad Zohar. The yet unnamed monkey was seen Thursday clinging to its mother’s back. Golden lion tamarins are among the rarest animals in the world, according to the World Wildlife Fund. It is listed as endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Jerusalem zoo says the primate was under threat of extinction in the 1980s when less than 100 were found in its native Brazil. But a breeding program in zoos around the world halted its decline. Today, there are hundreds of golden lion tamarins in the wild and in zoos worldwide. — AP An illustrative photo of a golden lion tamarin.

A statement from the State Department identifies the suspect as Joe Asperman and says he had been listed as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist.” “French national Joe Asperman is a senior chemical weapons expert for ISIS,” the statement says. “Asperman oversaw chemical operations production within Syria for ISIS and the deployment of these chemical weapons at the battlefront.” Although hundreds of French fighters are thought to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with jihadist groups like the Islamic State, Asperman’s name has not previously been reported. The US Treasury’s list of sanctioned terrorists says he is believed to have been born in the Cannes region on France’s southern, Mediterranean coast between 1986 and 1988. Along with Bashar Assad’s Damascus regime, the Islamic State terror group has also been accused of deploying chemical attacks in Syria, where it is one of the factions in the long-running civil war. Along with Asperman, the State Department also designates the Katibat al-Imam al-Bukhari, an armed group it describes as an Al Qaeda ally and “the largest Uzbek fighting force in Syria.” — AFP  Ultra-Orthodox clash with police in anti-draft protest Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators clash with police in Bnei Brak during protests against the mandatory military conscription of seminary students.

The embassy says the new process  only to those who received their visas after January 1, 2008, and were at least 14 years old when granted a visa.  Settlers illegally squatting in Hebron building begin to pack up A group of settlers who have been illegally squatting in a disputed Hebron building for the past eight months agree to evacuate the premises on Thursday, the IDF confirms. An army spokesman describes the evacuation of Beit Hamachpela as “peaceful,” with the residents agreeing to clear the building adjacent to the Tomb of the Patriarchs holy site despite their vehement opposition to the order. On March 12, the High Court of Justice ruled that the apartment complex had to be cleared of its 15 Israeli families, who were unable to prove that their purchase of the structure was legal. — Jacob Magid An Israeli border police officer guards outside the ‘Machpela House’ in the West Bank city Hebron on August 28, 2017.

Polish attorney general’s office calls Holocaust law unconstitutional WARSAW, Poland — The Polish attorney general’s office describes as partly unconstitutional the Holocaust law meant to defend Poland’s image abroad that instead drew criticism from Israel, Ukraine and the United States. The statement published Thursday comes as a surprise, as Prosecutor General Zbigniew Ziobro is also the head of the justice ministry that came up with the controversial law. The legislation, which came into force earlier this month, imposes fines or up to three years in jail on anyone who ascribes “responsibility or co-responsibility to the Polish nation or state for crimes committed by the German Third Reich.” The attorney general’s office publishes its statement on the website of the Constitutional Court, which was tasked by the president with checking whether the law was constitutional. The office says that penalizing acts committed abroad independently of the laws in place there was against the Constitution, which opposes “excessive interference.” It adds that the law is “dysfunctional,” could have “opposite results than those intended” and could “undermine the Polish state’s authority.” — AFP  Ultra-Orthodox block main highway during anti-draft protest Ultra-Orthodox protesters block Route 4 in both directions during anti-draft protest in central Israel, police say.

Asked at the White House whether he would like to testify, Trump says: “Yes. I would like to.” His comment comes shortly after his lead lawyer in the Russia investigation resigned amid a shake-up of the president’s legal team. Mueller is looking into contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, and Russian meddling in the presidential election.  Congressional panel calls on Zuckerberg to testify The leaders of a key House committee are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining company. Representatives Greg Walden of Oregon and Frank Pallone of New Jersey say in a statement the “latest revelations regarding Facebook’s use and security of user data raises many serious consumer protection concerns.” They say their staffs received a briefing yesterday from Facebook officials that left many questions unanswered. Walden is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Pallone is the panel’s top ranking Democrat. Their statement comes a day after Zuckerberg told CNN that he would be “happy” to testify before Congress. The lawmakers say they’ll work with Facebook and Zuckerberg to set a date and time “in the near future.” — AP Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during an interview session with The Atlantic at the Newseum in Washington, DC, September 18, 2013. (Jim Watson/AFP)  Poland puts Berlin’s WWII bill at 440 billion euros WARSAW, Poland — Polish victims of World War II should be able to claim 440 billion euros ($543 billion) from Germany in World War II damages, the head of a parliamentary commission says Thursday. Arkadiusz Mularczyk of the nationalist ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) bases the figure, which the German government rejects, on a 1990 study which found that “there were 13.32 million direct victims of Nazi Germany in Poland. That figure takes into account deportees, labor and concentration camp prisoners, civilians left maimed during that period, widows, orphans, and those who suffered from illnesses which broke out under Nazi occupation and during the conflict. Mularczyk says the 1990 study found that reparations of $284 billion should be paid. “That was the sum in 1990. If we revalue taking into account dollar purchasing power in 2017 we get 1.984 trillion zloty, or $543 billion,” the PAP news agency quotes Mularczyk as saying. The issue of German reparations had long been regarded as closed — but PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski revived the topic last year. Last year, then German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the issue had already been settled in August 1953 when Poland’s then communist administration said it renounced any right to war reparations. — AFP  Netanyahu: Likud will lead Israel for years to come Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a gathering of Likud activists in Tel Aviv to mark the upcoming Passover holiday. “The Likud is the strongest party in Israel. Together we are leading the state and together we will continue to lead it for many years,” he says. Netanyahu says the party will win more than the 30 Knesset seats it currently has in the next elections.  Netanyahu blasts press, claims ‘thuggish pressure’ working to topple Likud Netanyahu takes aim at the media and unnamed opponents, claiming corruption investigations involving him are a “witch hunt.” “Because it impossible to defeat us by democratic means, there are those who assert unceasing and thuggish pressure on law enforcement in order to topple us by other means,” says Netanyanhu.  CNN chief Jeff Zucker says Fox News is a ‘propaganda machine’ NEW YORK — CNN chief Jeff Zucker sharply attacks the network’s rivals at Fox News Channel on Thursday, saying that it has become a propaganda machine that is “doing an incredible disservice to the country.” Zucker is speaking at the Financial Times Future of News conference two days after a former Fox military analyst quit, claiming he was ashamed at the way the network’s opinion hosts were backing President Donald Trump. Zucker says that analyst, Ralph Peters, voiced what a lot of people have been thinking about Fox in the post-Roger Ailes era. “What has happened to that network in the last 18 months, especially the last year, is that it has just turned itself into state-run TV,” Zucker says. “TASS has nothing on them,” he says in reference to the Russian news agency. Zucker says that Fox has “a handful of good journalists but they get lost in the propaganda machine.” “The idea that they are a news channel is really not accurate at all,” he says. — AP In this Dec. 17, 2017, file photo, CNN president Jeff Zucker attends the 11th annual CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute in New York.

Still interested? If you said no, thanks, that sounds like a scam, I'm not signing over my private information but you're also a regular, longtime user of Facebook, then you're a hypocrite. How else did you think Facebook was free? How else did you think Mark Zuckerberg became a billionaire before his 25th birthday? The personal data of billions of Facebook users - you, me and all your Facebook friends - is online gold that can be used to make Facebook more addictive to its users and can also be sold to the highest bidder looking to reach a specific group of people with a specific message. Facebook, of course, doesn't take responsibility for that message, because the oversight needed to monitor that would destroy the social media giant's business model and make it far less valuable to investors. As various government and news media investigations are discovering, this process can be used to increase social divides, to encourage racism, to distort political views and even to influence elections. As more and more information has come forward about how Facebook turned a blind eye to how others were using its collection of personal data, including the weekend's revelation that a British company, Cambridge Analytica, may have used that information to sway both the Brexit vote in the UK and the last U.S. presidential election, people and investors are turning their back on Facebook. On Thursday morning, Facebook shares were selling for about $165 US each, a $20 drop from what the same share cost last Friday afternoon. That 11 per cent share decrease wiped out about $50 billion of Facebook's value. So when Zuckerberg finally appeared on CNN on Wednesday to apologize, what was he sorry about? Was he sorry that the personal data of Facebook users was sold to companies - and likely foreign governments - who could then use that data against the same Facebook users to manipulate and influence them? Was he sorry Facebook knew about this problem two years ago but did nothing? Was he sorry that he got caught and now people are mad? Or was he sorry that the company that made him so rich is now worth $50 billion less than what it was a week ago? So hard to tell. Devoted Facebook users are rising to the defence of their favourite app, the one that fills so much of their spare time, claiming they don't care what Facebook does with their information because of the personal value they get sharing their life story with the world. What harm could come from it, they ask? They think they are immune to the propaganda (the correct name for fake news) cleverly constructed and targeted for them from all of that personal information they so willingly shared. That's the thing with propaganda. Nobody walks around claiming they can be easily persuaded to think or act a certain way. Instead, everybody says they're too smart for that but all those other people, the ones that disagree with them, well, clearly they're stupid enough to believe everything they see or read on Facebook. Propaganda works so well precisely because the people who most loudly proclaim they're immune and everyone else are suckers are the biggest suckers of all. Facebook works so well because its users get to see the "Likes" to their cute photos and witty comments but hides what it does with all of that information users share about themselves, their friends and their families. That process is no longer invisible and now that people have seen behind Zuckerberg's curtain, they're furious that he used the story of their lives solely for the purposes of making himself and his friends rich. For those who are cutting the Facebook cord, they're discovering that their life before 2005 wasn't so bad after all. They sent emails and talked to people on the phone. They met for coffee or for dinner. They found out about what was going on in the world by following the news. They found out about what was going on in their community by chatting with their friends and neighbours. They didn't need the daily affirmation of "Likes" and "Loves" online because they already had it from the important people in their lives. They cared about privacy. Handing over private and personal information to a company offering some cheap toy was ridiculous. If Facebook died today, would the world, would Prince George, would people here and around the world be better or worse off? Turns out Facebook is just like everything else in the world that promises people so much goodness and value, all for free. It's just too good to be true. - Editor-in-chief Neil Godbout Read Related Topics   Begin: copyright, site specific labels, link back, pressboard © Copyright 2018 Prince George Citizen 'Please support the Prince George Citizen and online news like this by purchasing a digital subscription.'

These days the same might be said of social media; many people in political life have very serious criticisms not only of the way social media changes behaviour, permits abuse and trolling, and proliferates disinformation, but also of the basic business model. Political parties have always tried to collect information about voters. At the most simplistic level that means keeping records of conversations on the doorstep, finding out where their supporters are, and trying to understand what’s motivating them in their choices at the ballot box. But over recent decades the tools for collecting, storing, buying and analysing the data have become ever more sophisticated. The addition of global social media platforms into the mix, the monetisation of the data they harvest, and the creation of a window into the lives of vast numbers of people, has fundamentally disrupted the basic functions of democracy. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said years ago that “by giving people the power to share, we’re making the world more transparent”, few people realised how much information about us would be shared without our permission, or how much power that information would transfer into the hands of hidden, unaccountable players. The revelations about data from 50 million Facebook profiles being exploited by Cambridge Analytica, which has bragged of its disgraceful business practices, have made more people aware of how dangerous the situation has become. But it has also shown how dependent many powerful political forces have become on the very same companies responsible for these new dark arts. Some people are responding to these revelations by quitting the platform, deleting their Facebook accounts. Even those who are informed enough to delete the data at the same time (no simple task) will sadly not achieve a real change. Given how heavily people have come to rely on social media, we can’t expect change to come about because a small number of people leave. Instead we need a fundamental reassessment of the issues of data ownership, privacy and security. These have become abstract, intangible ideas, and they must become clear, legally enforceable principles. Social media, and the wider digital agenda, doesn’t need to be a threat to democracy; it could become a tool to empower people instead of empowering big business or authoritarian regimes. But that won’t happen by wishing for it, and those who have control of the system now won’t give it up easily. Back in 2014, when Scotland was on the verge of gaining powers in this area, the Greens tried to open up debate by publishing a paper on digital rights. We were concerned about the issues like whether people retain ownership of data about them, whether they can give truly informed consent for its use, what would happen to the gap between rich and poor in the digital age, and how to balance freedom of speech, privacy and intellectual property. Around the same time, the Royal Society of Edinburgh produced its own paper, which warned that “technology has so altered our capacity to acquire, store, process and communicate information that a number of issues that underpin modern society must be revisited: surveillance, anonymity, trust, copyright, privacy and freedom of speech, to name a few”. These issues have only become more urgent as the tech landscape has continued to develop. Yet both the Scottish and UK governments still talk about this issue in terms of the “digital economy” and “digital participation”. The never-ending spat over who is responsible for broadband coverage is a good example of this, as though download speeds matter but privacy and security simply aren’t on the agenda. There is also a danger that governments get swept along with anything “innovative” without examining the potential pitfalls. For example, the Scottish Government recently consulted on electoral reform, and suggested online voting as a way to increase turnout. But the evidence simply doesn’t stack up that it would achieve this, and it comes with a genuine threat to the security, anonymity and verifiability that elections depend upon. A piece of paper, put into a metal or plastic box with a physical secure tag on it, opened in front of people’s eyes and counted physically gives a tangible sense of trust. And that trust is deserved, because the system is indeed secure, and the evidence is that abuse is extremely low. Even if a technological solution is theoretically possible (which has not been shown) the more complex it is the fewer people will be able to understand it, and the less trust people will have in the system. Electronic voting, like New Labour’s ill-fated ID Database scheme, might hold some appeal to governments and certainly offers opportunities to the businesses which want to sell the tech. But it could result in yet more opportunities for powerful interests to manipulate insecure systems, and for big data to be used against the interests of a democratic society. There is no simple solution to all of this, and many relevant powers are currently outwith the control of Scotland. But teaching our children to be creative people in the online world, as opposed to passive consumers; developing a media-savvy and network-literate population; building open-source solutions to the technical challenges we face, and placing digital rights in the heart of policy; these are within our grasp now, and should be urgent priorities.     redesign ResponsiveArticleDisplayComments      standard BlockMegaNewsMostPopular Most popular Most commented Tab panes Loading...

Have technological advances and the advent of social media given organisations, such as Cambridge Analytica, too much power to influence and manipulate on a global scale? Following Mark Zuckerberg’s apology for millions of Facebook users having their data exploited, Cybersecurity expert, Dr Daniel Dresner, writes that it isn’t the technology we should be worrying about, but the people creating and using these tools instead. We invest a lot of unconscious trust in the apparently quick and free services coming at us over the Internet. However, since we don’t pay for the vast majority of our online content using traditional cash-based transactions we pay, instead, with our data. Following the continuing fallout from Cambridge Analytica scandal, the question for many now though is, ‘to what extent?’ Go online and you’re bombarded with everything from advertising and product surveys to joke apps and personality quizzes. Every click, like, purchase and online interaction yields some sort of data – even if it’s just closing a window on screen or unsubscribing to a service – it all counts. This data can and will be used for a variety of purposes. Many of them will be benign or mostly harmless. They might make your shopping easier or recommend a song or album to enjoy based on previous decisions. [if IE

M&C; Saatchi chief executive David Kershaw likened Facebook’s “abuse of data” to the panic faced by large companies when their adverts appeared alongside jihadi videos on YouTube, owned by Google. With advertisers threatening to pull out of Facebook, Kershaw said it needs to act fast. “On the one hand Facebook is a fantastic advertising medium. However, it is clear that they are somewhat out of control. The abuse of data issue has brought it to a head.” He was talking just hours after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg issued a belated apology for a “breach of trust” which saw millions of users having their data exploited by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Kershaw was talking as M&C; reported a 12% jump in revenue to £251 million, and a 16% leap in profits to £28 million, another record year. That contrasts with the results of giant media agencies such as WPP and Publicis, which have been whacked by a cutback in spending by large fast-moving consumer goods clients such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble. They are also facing the suggestion that the large ad agency model is broken. Said Kershaw: “Because we are bottom-up local partners, we don’t have FMCG accounts, so we have escaped all that.”  He added: “We are also not M&A; junkies,” an apparent reference to WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell, who has been criticised for seeking growth through acquisitions. “We might buy something tactically small, but our default position is to start businesses,” he said. M&C; Saatchi was founded in 1995 by brothers Maurice and Charles after they quit their own firm Saatchi and Saatchi. Maurice remains involved with M&C.; It is raising its dividend by 15% to 9.53p. The shares were up 3p to 405p, which values the business at £332 million. M&C; has done recent campaigns for NatWest and Visit Britain. Mobile advertising is 15% of its business, a proportion likely to rise. Talking to CNN, Zuckerberg said he was “really sorry” and admitted to a “responsibility to protect your data”. Kershaw noted Facebook has to lose $50 billion of market value before it took the issue seriously.

New technology has sparked a wave of literacy and empowered billions of people around the world. The internet opens up new possibilities and our lives have been transformed by innovations making everyday living easier. We should cherish this freedom. But not the freedom to do harm. There comes a time when the pendulum swings. When the adolescents who moved fast and broke things grow up. When the rights and responsibilities that govern our offline world need to be brought to bear. That moment has come for social media. The tech giants can no longer evade scrutiny. Their profits are built on the data we entrust them with when we use their platforms. But as recent events have shown they have big questions to answer: what data do they hold on us, how was it obtained and how have they been using it?   Yesterday a former platform operations manager at Facebook appeared in front of a Commons committee and said Facebook executives who are still at the company were made aware of his concerns about data vulnerabilities. He said Facebook failed to do enough to identify data breaches and failed to act when informed about them. He said the company gave the impression that it feared if it investigated a suspected breach and found policies or laws were broken it would be liable and so it did not investigate.  Matt Hancock: Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (EPA) The public is rightly furious and wants action. We need more transparency to rebuild trust.  The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), under the impressive Elizabeth Denham, is already investigating as part of a broader investigation into the use of personal data during political campaigns. She has already issued 12 information notices to a range of organisations, using powers under the Data Protection Act. All those involved in the investigation, starting with Cambridge Analytica , must co-operate however the commissioner sees fit.  Facebook CEO breaks silence on Cambridge Analytica scandal Facebook must reveal what it knows. Overnight, Mark Zuckerberg has promised to fully comply with the investigations, and gone further with measures to stop abuse. I welcome these measures. But we cannot rely on the decisions of a private company to govern how citizens’ data can be used. It’s the job of Government to ensure that companies behave reasonably. It is not for companies to decide on the delicate balance between privacy and innovation, but for society as a whole. I believe in the liberal values of cherishing freedom while protecting the freedom of others. We need to bring these values to bear in the online world. I am determined too that we must not leap to the wrong conclusions and overreact, damaging our digital economy. I am passionately pro-tech, which is precisely why I know that we need new data rules for transparency, clarity and fairness, to foster the trust in digital services on which digital innovation depends.  I have felt for some time these rules needed strengthening. Last year we published our new data protection bill to strengthen laws and give the ICO tougher powers to make organisations comply. The ICO will be able to levy significant fines for malpractice against organisations which block investigations. The bill will give people more control over their data, make those who handle it more secure and increase transparency.  Facebook is ‘out of control’, warns M&C; Saatchi ads guru Because of the lessons learned in this current investigation and the difficulties in getting appropriate responses from those involved, we are working together to examine what further powers may be needed to deal with complex investigations like these, including on-the-spot searches and the power to compel testimony from individuals. If we need to act then we will do so. But there is more. Now is the time for us to look at the wider responsibilities of tech companies. This is the moment for the Government to broker a new settlement between tech companies, society and the state, to put more power and control back in the hands of people who use social media. The days of an unregulated Wild West are over. The new settlement must set the highest ethical standards for those using people’s data. People must have confidence in how their data is used and know it cannot be used in ways they would not want. But this new settlement will be broader still.  We laid our plans for our Digital Charter earlier this year. It set out how we intend to agree norms and rules for the online world and put them into practice. This covers internet safety, the ethics of artificial intelligence, and how we protect intellectual property online. All these areas need a strong new framework so the internet works for citizens.  We want to work with the tech companies, civil society, businesses and others to reach this new settlement. In some cases this will be through shifting expectations of behaviour. In some cases we will need to agree new standards. In others we may need to update our laws — and we are prepared to legislate further if we need to. Our ambition is to make sure the UK is the safest place in the world to be online and the best place in the world to start and grow a digital business. We stand at a pivotal moment to shape our digital future and we intend to grasp it. We must rise to meet these challenges so we can achieve our aim of building a country that works for everyone whether online or off.

These are external links and will open in a new window  Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal  The suspended chief of Cambridge Analytica has been asked to appear before MPs again amid claims about the company's use of Facebook user data. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee said evidence Alexander Nix gave to its fake news inquiry last month contained "inconsistencies". It said this includes his denial the company was supplied data by a firm behind an app that harvested personal details, or worked with Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing. Mr Nix was suspended by the London-based political consultancy on Tuesday after footage broadcast on Channel 4 appeared to show him suggesting tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. In a letter , the committee chairman, Damian Collins, requested Mr Nix supply further evidence following material published in the media this week. He said MPs were interested in asking him about his "denial that your company received data from the Global Science Research company" and "your claim that you 'do not work with Facebook data, and... do not have Facebook data'." The parliamentary committee has also called for Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence about its use of personal data. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, claimed it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life that was created by an academic for Global Science Research. Earlier, a High Court hearing on an attempt by the UK's information commissioner to search the office of Cambridge Analytica was adjourned until Friday. Elizabeth Denham is seeking a warrant to access to the databases and servers of the company amid claims it improperly used data from Facebook users on behalf of political clients. The move is part of her wider investigation into political campaigning. The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Facebook's biggest challenge yet Ad firms warn Facebook 'enough is enough' Zuckerberg speaks out on data breaches The Information Commissioner's Office said it was seeking a warrant because Cambridge Analytica did not respond to its 7 March request to access records and data it held. Ms Denham has said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in "an unauthorised way", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when they found out about the loss of the data. She said Facebook had been told to withdraw from its own search of Cambridge Analytica's offices, saying there were concerns it might damage the integrity of her investigation. Cambridge Analytica says it has been "fully compliant and proactive" with the ICO since 2017. In a statement , the company said: "We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection. "We remain committed to helping the ICO and all other concerned organisations in their investigations and audits." 'Wild West' Speaking in the Commons, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said this week's revelations represented a "turning point" in the debate on the use of personal information stored online. In response to a question from Labour MP Chi Onwurah, who called for the introduction of a "digital bill of rights", Mr Hancock said: "It is increasingly clear that we need a new settlement with these big tech companies." "This Wild West free-for-all of the internet companies has got to come to an end," he added. Shadow digital minister Liam Byrne said it was "ludicrous" that a search warrant had still not been obtained by the ICO and suggested it did not have sufficient power to conduct investigations properly. But Mr Hancock said: "The truth is the data protection bill currently before Parliament is all about strengthening this enforcement and strengthening people's consent." Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said while the case raised a "serious issue" and data harvesting had to be "dealt with," the party would still maintain its Facebook account. It has also emerged that ISBA, a trade body which represents major UK advertisers, will meet Facebook this week. The Times reports if Facebook fails to provide assurances about the security of users' data, advertisers may decide to spend money elsewhere. Hancock: Data breach is 'creepy' What is the row about? In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but Whistleblower Christopher Wylie says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. Media playback is unsupported on your device Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far He claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica - which has no connection with Cambridge University - which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Donald Trump material to them. Dr Kogan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was "perfectly legal and within the terms of service" and he was being used as a "scapegoat". What other investigations are under way? US senators have called on Mr Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how his company will protect users, while consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission has also reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook . The head of the European Parliament also said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. Media playback is unsupported on your device Information Commissioner: We need to get in to Cambridge Analytica offices On Tuesday a Cambridge University spokesperson said they had "sought and received assurances" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that, but were writing to Facebook to "request all relevant evidence in their possession". There have also been calls for an investigation into the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya. How have Facebook and Cambridge Analytica responded? On Wednesday, Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg broke cover for the first time since the revelations emerged to say that a "breach of trust" had occurred and he was "really sorry". Earlier Facebook said users' data was obtained legitimately but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when told to do so. A Facebook spokesperson said Dr Kogan was not allowed to transfer data to Cambridge Analytica, a third-party who would use the set for commercial purposes. They added that sharing users' friends data outside the app was also against Facebook's rules. Media playback is unsupported on your device Tuesday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying he met Donald Trump 'many times' For its part, Cambridge Analytica says in 2014 it had engaged Global Science Research "in good faith to legally supply data". Cambridge Analytica says it did delete the data when told to by Facebook. It says it did not use the data as part of the services provided to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Although Cambridge Analytica suspended chief executive Alexander Nix following his comments to Channel 4 News , the firm said reports on the story had "grossly misrepresented" his comments. Before Channel 4 News had broadcast any of the secret filming, Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been "deliberately entrapped".

It is alleged that 50 million users of the social media giant had their personal details harvested by CA, which were then said to have been used in elections and political campaign. The British firm denies any wrongdoing. Facebook has seen billions of dollars wiped off its market value following the scandal, but buying back users' trust may take longer than regaining the cash. Social media is all about perception, and many Facebook users seem shocked by the recent revelations, leading many people to review their relationship with the site. "If I like something, and now that information is being sold for nefarious purposes like this, I won't like that," one Facebook user told ITV News. Another user said that she would no longer be posting on her account.  One Facebook user told ITV News she would no longer post on her account. Credit: ITV News Another user told ITV News she would delete her account. However, many executives in Silicon Valley are reported to be questioning why social media users are so surprised that their details were allegedly used. They are said to be left wondering why people assumed that social media would come for free, arguing instead that users pay for it by allowing organisations to learn about and profile them, allowing advertisers to target them better.  One woman told ITV News she would delete her personal Facebook account in the wake of the scandal. Credit: ITV News On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it was "clearly a mistake" to trust CA when Facebook asked the firm to delete tens of millions of users' data. In an interview with CNN Mr Zuckerberg apologised to users of his site, calling it a "major breach of trust, and I'm really sorry that this happened. "We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data, and if we can't do that, they we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people."  Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence to speak to CNN. Credit: CNN After apologising, the 33-year-old set out Facebook's plans to ensure that such an incident does not happen again, with thousands of apps being checked and reviewed and privacy policies tightened. "This isn't rocket science, there is a lot of hard work that we need to do to make it harder for nation states like Russia to do election interference, to make it so that trolls and other folks can't spread fake news, but we can get in front of this," Mr Zuckerberg told the US television channel.

Alexander Nix has been asked to attend another grilling by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee. Meanwhile Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said the revelations about Facebook and CA marked a “turning point” in people’s attitudes to their online data. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary said new measures coming into force in May could leave Facebook facing a fine of more than £1 billion if it breached data laws and promised the Information Commissioner would also be given beefed-up powers. But the data watchdog has yet to be granted a warrant to search CA’s computers as part of its current investigation and Mr Hancock acknowledged the “system isn’t good enough” at present. . @CommonsCMS have recalled Alexander Nix to give evidence following recent reports in @guardian @nytimes and @Channel4News pic.twitter.com/nILljso1yV — Damian Collins (@DamianCollins) March 22, 2018 The decision by MPs to recall Mr Nix comes after Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan – who developed a personality survey used to harvest tens of millions of people’s data for CA – contradicted some of his evidence. Dr Kogan said Mr Nix was wrong when he told MPs he had not been supplied data by the academic’s firm Global Science Research (GSR). Mr Nix told MPs that GSR “did some research for us back in 2014” that “proved to be fruitless”. Asked if that was wrong, Dr Kogan told the BBC: “I believe it is. I don’t see why that would be accurate.” Select committee chairman Damian Collins said in a letter to Mr Nix – who was suspended earlier this week – that there were “a number of inconsistencies” in the evidence given on his appearance on February 27, “notably your denial that your company received data from the Global Science Research company”. He added: “Giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter. We urge you to come forward and explain your comments at a committee hearing.” Matt Hancock said the revelations marked a “turning point” in online attitudes (Ian West/PA) Mr Hancock told a Westminster lunch it was “time that social media platforms come clean with what data they really hold on people”. The new powers in the Data Protection Bill mean that the Information Commissioner can levy fines of up to 4% of global turnover if social media platforms do not play by the rules, he said. “This means Facebook – if it breaks the rules – could face fines of up to £1.1 billion from May. “The Bill also means that people will have the right to move all their data wholesale from one social network to another. “So from May if people lose trust in a social media platform they can move to another one at the click of a button. “This will concentrate minds.” Mr Hancock – who has faced privacy concerns over his own social media app for constituents – said: “I think this week has marked a turning point in people’s attitude towards the big platforms.” He added:  “You can’t just let the companies decide what is the balance between privacy and use of data and innovation. That is a decision for society, reflected in the laws that we pass here.” Facebook’s boss Mark Zuckerberg said it was a mistake to rely on CA to delete tens of millions of Facebook users’ data, as he apologised for the “major breach of trust”. He said the political consultancy had provided formal assurances that information harvested from 50 million profiles had been destroyed after Facebook first learned of the breach in 2015.

Facebook shares have tumbled since the first allegations and the tech giant has suffered an online backlash (Dominic Lipinski/PA) Mr Hancock said: “Of course I understand why people are deleting Facebook accounts. “Without trust people will understandably continue to remove their Facebook accounts and without transparency over how data is used there can be no trust.”  KEYWORDS UK Sci-Tech Politics Cambridge UK Alexander Nix Cambridge Analytica News Daily Headlines Receive our lunchtime briefing straight to your inbox More in this Section EE launches data gifting service to let users share allowance Apple and Microsoft among firms to agree new standard on Braille displays Tesla hits parked police car in California ‘while using Autopilot’ Fallout 76 is the next game in the post-apocalyptic wasteland Today's Stories Funds boost for Indaver incinerator challenge Adoption scandal is only going to get bigger A mother’s search: ‘My baby could have been given to a couple anywhere’ State may pay for travel to Britain in cases of fatal foetal diagnosis Lifestyle New father’s life ‘changed forever’ after he was run over by surgeon The biggest cancer killer will take your breath away Hopefully she had an idea...

A brief explanation by a data lawyer An undercover investigation by Channel 4 News has accused British data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica of secretly campaigning in elections across the world. In a documentary aired on Channel 4 on Monday night, high-profile figures from Cambridge Analytica were filmed discussing the use of bribes, ex-spies, fake IDs and sex workers to influence elections. The company reportedly harvested data from millions of Facebook users to deliver micro-targeted ads. It's saucy stuff, and #DeleteFacebook has been trending on Twitter since. We spoke to Jonathan Compton, Partner at city law firm DMH Stallard, who is one of the UK's leading experts in data protection. He has lots of letters after his name, like LLB and MCIArb, and has represented UK and international clients in courts in England and Wales including the Commercial Court of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Who is Cambridge Analytica? Cambridge Analytica is a private company, registered in the UK.

They have links to Steve Bannon and are alleged to have assisted in the election of US President Trump by data analysis of voters in swing states to target their candidate's advertisement on an individual's primary concerns, driver, fears, hopes, however, you want to put it. Why are they in the news?  They are alleged to have harvested data from 50 million Facebook users in order to provide better services to their clients (which are alleged to have included the Trump election team.) How did they scrape FB data?  Cambridge Analytica asserts that they acted lawfully at all times and with the consent of the Facebook users to gather their personal data. The allegation is that whatever consent was given by those Facebook users, it did not include or was not specific enough to include data harvesting for election purposes. Facebook maintain they acted lawfully. Facebook acknowledges that they knew of the harvesting of the 50 million users since 2015 but acted lawfully in not notifying those users. Is it a data Wild West out there? Frankly, yes. The recent revelations about UK company Cambridge Analytica Limited call into question the data protection regime in this country and, more broadly, in the USA. Chris Wylie, the whistleblower at the heart of the story, revealed this week how Cambridge Analytica Limited used personal information taken, allegedly from Facebook, without authorisation in early 2014 to create algorithms to predict and to influence voting patterns in the US elections. Chris Wylie told the UK Observer newspaper “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on”. This is the allegation being made. Facebook confirmed in a statement that by the end of 2015, it knew that information had been ‘harvested’ on a hitherto unknown scale. It is alleged that Facebook failed to notify users of this. The scale of the ‘harvesting’ amounted to 50,000,000 users. Under the UK Data Protection Act 1998 there is no duty on Facebook to tell its users (even those users affected) that their data has been ‘harvested’. I make it clear that, in full compliance with UK data protection laws, Facebook had no legal obligation either to notify the UK Information Commissioner nor its users. Interestingly, it is understood that Facebook’s UK legal advisers have written to the Observer stating that the Observer has made “false and defamatory” comment and has reserved Facebook’s legal position. In short, under the DPA in its current form, there are protections afforded to individuals and their personal data. The issue is enforcement. If there is no current obligation to report breaches, then wrong-doing can go unnoticed. Further, even under the new GDPR, if the UKIC has to apply for a warrant, the opportunity in the delay is given to those in breach of data protection rules to cover their tracks. Finally, if potential ‘wrong-doers’ (for want of a better word) can use the law of Libel to silence whistle-blowers, then ‘Houston, we have a problem’. The law on data protection is about to change with the coming into force of the GDPR under the auspices of the Data Protection Bill. This Bill is scheduled to come into force on May 25. Those who process and control data need to be aware of their new obligations. But even this new Bill has shortcomings with the lack of a true ‘dawn raid’ powers.

Ebury is rushing to publish The People Vs Tech: How the internet is killing democracy (and how we save it) following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Authored by Jamie Bartlett, the director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media and the presenter of the BBC documentary "Secrets of Silicon Valley", the "timely polemic" argues that the internet is "killing democracy" and puts forth 20 "radical" proposals as to what can be done about it. The book's publication has been brought forward from 31st May to 5th April in e-book and 19th April in physical edition.  According to Ebury, the release schedule was changed following "the explosive news of Cambridge Analytica’s alarming role in Brexit and the US election". Data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica’ is currently embroiled, along with Facebook, in a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the UK Brexit referendum or the US presidential election. The premise of Bartlett's book is that digital technology and our democracy are incompatible, and we must reform democracy and reign in digital disruption within the next 20 years - or risk losing democracy for good. Bartlett said the tension between our analogue democracy and our digital technologies had become "increasingly obvious" and was "one of the most pressing questions of our time". "On the current trajectory, democracy won't survive. This book sets out an alternative," he added. Among the author's proposals are new government policies and laws, as well as what is described by Ebury as "a citizen fightback". Ebury deputy publishing director Andrew Goodfellow said the book "brilliantly anchored the overload of noise in the press, distilling the swirling debate down to what we need to know and what we can do to make change".

How companies learn about your hopes and fears     Cambridge Analytica's approach represents a step change in how analytics can be used as a tool to generate insights - and to exert influence  Cambridge Analytica used behavioural analytics and psychographic profiling to get to know voters' minds and understand people better By  Michael Wade , IMD Business School The dealings that have been revealed between Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have all the trappings of a Hollywood thriller: a Bond villain-style CEO, a reclusive billionaire, a naïve and conflicted whistle-blower, a hipster data scientist turned politico, an academic with seemingly questionable ethics, and of course a triumphant president and his influential family. Much of the discussion has been on how Cambridge Analytica was able to obtain data on more than 50m Facebook users – and how it allegedly failed to delete this data when told to do so. But there is also the matter of what Cambridge Analytica actually did with the data. In fact the data crunching company's approach represents a step change in how analytics can today be used as a tool to generate insights – and to exert influence. For example, pollsters have long used segmentation to target particular groups of voters, such as through categorising audiences by gender, age, income, education and family size. Segments can also be created around political affiliation or purchase preferences. The data analytics machine that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton used in her 2016 campaign – named Ada after the 19th-century mathematician and early computing pioneer – used state-of-the-art segmentation techniques to target groups of eligible voters in the same way that Barack Obama had done four years previously. Making connections through tracking data behaviour. Photo: GarryKillian/Shutterstock Cambridge Analytica was contracted to the Trump campaign and provided an entirely new weapon for the election machine. While it also used demographic segments to identify groups of voters, as Clinton's campaign had, Cambridge Analytica also segmented using psychographics . As definitions of class, education, employment, age and so on, demographics are informational. Psychographics are behavioural – a means to segment by personality. This makes a lot of sense. It's obvious that two people with the same demographic profile (for example, white, middle-aged, employed, married men) can have markedly different personalities and opinions. We also know that adapting a message to a person's personality – whether they are open, introverted, argumentative, and so on – goes a long way to help getting that message across. Understanding people better There have traditionally been two routes to ascertaining someone's personality. You can either get to know them really well – usually over an extended time. Or you can get them to take a personality test and ask them to share it with you. Neither of these methods is realistically open to pollsters. Cambridge Analytica found a third way, with the assistance of two University of Cambridge academics. The first, Aleksandr Kogan, sold them access to 270,000 personality tests completed by Facebook users through an online app he had created for research purposes. Providing the data to Cambridge Analytica was, it seems, against Facebook's internal code of conduct, but only now in March 2018 has Kogan been banned by Facebook from the platform. In addition, Kogan's data also came with a bonus: he had reportedly collected Facebook data from the test-takers' friends – and, at an average of 200 friends per person, that added up to some 50m people. However, these 50m people had not all taken personality tests. This is where the second Cambridge academic, Michal Kosinski , came in. Kosinski – who is said to believe that micro-targeting based on online data could strengthen democracy – had figured out a way to reverse engineer a personality profile from Facebook activity such as likes. Whether you choose to like pictures of sunsets, puppies or people apparently says a lot about your personality. So much, in fact, that on the basis of 300 likes, Kosinski's model is able to predict someone's personality profile with the same accuracy as a spouse . Something different for everyone. GaudiLab via Shutterstock Kogan developed Kosinksi's ideas, improved them, and cut a deal with Cambridge Analytica. Armed with this bounty – and combined with additional data gleaned from elsewhere – Cambridge Analytica built personality profiles for more than 100m registered US voters. It's claimed the company then used these profiles for targeted advertising. Imagine for example that you could identify a segment of voters that is high in conscientiousness and neuroticism, and another segment that is high in extroversion but low in openness. Clearly, people in each segment would respond differently to the same political ad. But on Facebook they do not need to see the same ad at all – each will see an individually tailored ad designed to elicit the desired response, whether that is voting for a candidate, not voting for a candidate, or donating funds. Cambridge Analytica worked hard to develop dozens of ad variations on different political themes such as immigration, the economy and gun rights, all tailored to different personality profiles. There is no evidence at all that Clinton's election machine had the same ability. Behavioural analytics and psychographic profiling are here to stay, no matter what becomes of Cambridge Analytica – which has robustly criticised what it calls "false allegations in the media". In a way it industrialises what good salespeople have always done, by adjusting their message and delivery to the personality of their customers. This approach to electioneering – and indeed to marketing – will be Cambridge Analytica's ultimate legacy.

The Republican-written report will be released to the public after it goes to the intelligence community for a classification review. The document has been fiercely opposed by Democrats, who say that the investigation was shut down too quickly and that the committee has not interviewed enough witnesses or gathered enough evidence to make such an assessment. All the Democrats on the intelligence panel voted against approving the report. Committee Republicans released a summary of 44 findings that concludes that there were Russian cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions and that Russians leveraged social media in the U.S. to sow discord. The report also echoes GOP criticism of the Justice Department and intelligence community as it investigated the meddling. The panel will release the context of those findings once intelligence agencies have reviewed it and decided what should be blacked out. In terms of collusion with Trump’s Republican campaign, the summary says that “none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.” The findings said that the committee found no evidence that Trump’s “pre-campaign business dealings” formed any basis for collusion with Russia during the campaign or that meetings between the Russian ambassador and Trump associates represented coordination in any way. Republicans on the committee also said there’s no evidence that Trump associates had anything to do with hacked emails that were stolen from Democrats during the campaign, though they do note “numerous ill-advised contacts with WikiLeaks.” Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., messaged with the group during the campaign. In an intelligence assessment released in January 2017, the National Security Agency, CIA and FBI concluded that Russian military intelligence provided hacked information from the Democratic National Committee and “senior Democratic officials” to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has denied that Russia was the source of emails it released, including those from Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Texas Rep. Mike Conaway, the Republican leading the House investigation, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the panel wanted to get the report out as the 2018 campaign season begins. He said that it would be difficult for Russians to have an impact on a specific congressional race but that they could “practice” this time around for bigger disruption during the 2020 presidential election. On collusion and coordination, Conaway said, “We could not find a thread to follow that made sense.” The report recommends that the intelligence community immediately inform candidates if they find a counterintelligence threat and proposes that campaigns better ensure that “their counterintelligence defenses appropriately account for the role of cut-outs and intermediaries.” It also says Congress should amend campaign finance laws to increase transparency with foreign entities. After the committee vote, the panel’s top Democrat, California Rep. Adam Schiff, said he had hoped Thursday’s meeting could have been public. “It is a rather sad chapter in our committee’s long history with the ending of the majority’s participation in the investigation, that ending taking place in secret session for no reason at all except a desire to avoid public scrutiny of this decision, to curtail an investigation into one of the most serious intrusions into our democracy and our history,” Schiff said. Democrats will have their own report and say they will continue to investigate the meddling. They have already set up at least one interview: Chris Wylie, a former employee of a political data-mining firm that obtained information from Facebook users without their consent. The firm, Cambridge Analytica, worked for the Trump campaign. Wylie told news outlets that the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories. It is unclear if Republicans on the committee will attend that interview.

This Is the Scariest News of the Trump Presidency He’s gone full neocon with John Bolton as his new national security advisor.  .entry-header Looking for news you can trust? Subscribe to our free newsletters.  President Trump announced Thursday night that he is replacing National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster with former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton—a step that puts a man famous for advocating preemptive wars in a position to help start one. Following Trump’s nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State, Bolton’s appointment means Trump has handed national security policy to the hawks. McMaster has been known for restraining Trump’s bellicose tendencies. There is little sign Bolton will do the same. Just last month he urged a preemptive military strike by the United States on North Korea. “It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current ‘necessity’ posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons by striking first,” he wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. Bolton was a leading advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and served in the George W. Bush administration, first as an undersecretary of state for arms control and nonproliferation, where he opposed international arms control and nonproliferation efforts. He was then a UN Ambassador who opposed international organizations like the very one he was working in. Since leaving government he has positioned himself as a Republican political operative—and he mulled 2012 presidential bid—as well as a reliable supporter for war. In 2009, Bolton, in a speech at the University of Chicago, seemed to call for Israel to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Iran: “Unless Israel is prepared to use nuclear weapons against Iran’s program, Iran will have nuclear weapons in the very near future.” In a 2012 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, he  joked about a nuclear attack on Chicago, President Obama’s hometown. The crack was part of a riff in which he accused Obama of lacking a backbone in dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Obama “put us in a greatly weakened position” with Russia, Bolton said. But Bolton’s views on Russia have since apparently evolved. On Fox News on Thursday, Bolton declined to fault Trump’s decision to congratulate Putin on his victory in an election widely seen as illegitimate—a move that drew bipartisan condemnation . “It’s a matter of being polite,” Bolton said. In 2013, Bolton was himself “polite,” taking part in a bizarre video in which he implored the Russian government to loosen gun laws. The video was used by a Russian gun rights group created by Alexander Torshin, a former Russian senator and ally of Putin. At the time, Torshin was trying to cultivate ties to the National Rifle Association and went on to seek contact with the 2016 Trump campaign. Torshin is now the subject of a reported FBI investigation  into whether he used the NRA to funnel funds to Trump’s campaign. That is not Bolton’s only tie to the Trump-Russia scandal. He heads a superPAC that has paid at least $1.1 million to political data firm Cambridge Analytica—the company accused of improperly obtaining data on at least 50 million Facebook users and which also had ties to other Russians. The biggest donor to Bolton’s committee, forking over more than $3 million since 2015, is Robert Mercer, the billionaire founder of Cambridge Analytica. Bolton is a uniquely controversial and dangerous pick as Trump’s top national security aide. CNN  reported  Thursday that Bolton promised Trump “he wouldn’t start any wars” in the new job. But now the worry is that it is Trump who will start the wars—and that John Bolton will help him.

Labour MP Jo Stevens, who sits on the committee investigating fake news, said evidence was given on Wednesday by a former Facebook operations manager, "which if it is correct would mean that there have been breaches of electoral law in the UK both in relation to the 2016 referendum and the general election last year, we believe." But how was the data collected and used? "That could be done either by using data about what they liked on Facebook [or] what they'd posted on Facebook, so they could search against keywords. They could search against, for example, immigration or Brexit or something like that and create lists of thousands, tens of thousands, millions of people that could then be micro-targetted with political advertising," Stevens said. The comments came amid mounting pressure on Facebook by British lawmakers following reports that UK-based firm Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained the personal information of more than 50 million of its users. Cambridge Analytica was hired for Donald Trump's 2016 US presidential election campaign, and is also under scrutiny over alleged links to the Leave campaign in the UK referendum. The British firm and leaders of Leave.EU have previously boasted about working together during the Brexit campaign.

Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images (until 1.45pm) and Thu 22 Mar 2018 First published on Thu 22 Mar 2018      Show       Show   1.44pm Sanctions move "a high risk strategy" The US move to impose sanctions on China is a high risk strategy, says Mike Jakeman, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: This has been clearly signposted by the Trump administration and is actually likely to prove broadly popular with US businesses and in Congress. The Democratic minority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, welcomed it as a sign of the US standing up to China. But there is a lot riding on China’s response. The US is gambling that any response will be proportionate. China could hit the US hard in return, by making access to the local market harder for US farmers, for example. Were farmers faced with falling prices for the exports and higher prices at home because of the import tariffs, the popularity of the tariffs would diminish quickly. This is a high-risk strategy for the US administration and one that is likely to weaken, rather than strengthen, the global economy.    1.23pm And here’s Trump’s signed tariff sanctions against China:    Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA Updated at 1.33pm EDT    12.58pm Trump calls for reciprocal deals President Trump is signing the order to impose tariffs on China, which he says could be up to $60bn. He says he has been talking to senior Chinese representatives and asked them to cut the deficit by $100bn immediately. He says he wants reciprical deals. “If they charge us, we charge them the same thing.” He says China charges 25% for a US car go in,”but we charge 2% for their cars to come into the US - that’s not good.” He says he has been talking to China, Japan, Europe, and every single one of them wants to negotiate. “In meantime we are sending a section 301 action which I will sign here.”    Photograph: Bloomberg TV    12.10pm A number of countries look like they will be exempt from the proposed US tariffs on steel and aluminium, including the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea. China of course is clearly in the frame. Here is the European side, from Daniel Boffey in Brussels: The EU believes it has won a temporary reprieve from president Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium after appealing to Washington to take a step back from a potential trade war. Following intensive talks in the US, the EU’s commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, said she believed the omens were good, although she indicated concern that the situation could unravel. The US is set to impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminium on Friday. The EU has argued that it should be exempt and has threatened to impose a series of retaliatory measures including import duties on US products. On returning to Brussels after a two-day trip, Malmstrom said she was confident the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, would suggest a temporary exemption for the EU but conceded that the decision remained in Trumps’ hands. “We expect that we are on that list, we don’t know for sure,” she told the European parliament. “It is ultimately the president who decides this. But we expect that secretary Ross will recommend that the EU is excluded as a whole.” The proposed tariffs’ main target is China, which has been flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminium. However, Trump has had few kind words to say about the EU, claiming that it had made life difficult for US exporters.

Our economics editor Larry Elliott says it would be a suprise if there is no increase but the Bank has been careful to give itself some wriggle room: A rate rise will depend on the economic data that is published over the next month and a half, but judging by the minutes of the MPC’s March meeting that data would have to be quite poor for Threadneedle Street to sit tight. His full analysis is here: Spoiler alert: Bank of England's hints of May rate rise are not subtle Read more And here’s our news story on the Bank’s announcement: UK interest rates stay on hold but Bank of England hints at rise Read more Updated at 11.35am EDT   11.26am The weakness in the FTSE 100 could mean UK-listed companies being targets for potential predators, says Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor,: At current levels, the FTSE100 is just a few points from being down 10% in the year to date, knocking on the door of what is often described as correction territory. UK equities on the whole have fallen out of favour with international investors with the spectre of Brexit looming, whilst the recent relative strength of sterling has meant additional pressure on the premier index, where the majority of earnings come from overseas. Meanwhile, the possibility of trade disputes particularly between China and the US is denting sentiment, and the move towards tighter monetary policy is another brick in the wall of worry which investors are currently climbing. This is despite the global, synchronised economic recovery where corporate earnings have so far continued to justify some slightly rich valuations, especially in the US. The UK economy has remained resilient despite any impending Brexit fallout, with the result that some of the top quality FTSE100 companies are moving towards bargain territory – and could even, as a consequence of this index weakness, find foreign groups running the slide rule over some of them as potential bid targets.   div necessary for flexbox of Newest  Oldest  Business Business live  Stock markets Bank of England Federal Reserve Mark Carney            View all comments >  Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Photograph: Richard Gardner/REX/Shutterstock  Thu 22 Mar 2018 First published on Thu 22 Mar 2018      Show       Show   1.03pm As the Times’ Bruno Waterfield points out, there was another error in the Lib Dem press release. That mistaken Lib Dem press release - Charles Michel wasn’t even at the lunch pic.twitter.com/PQEItIirHa March 22, 2018    12.49pm More from my colleague Jessica Elgot on the Lib Dem snafu. Lib Dems say Brexit referendum statement was a verbal agreement in the meeting with the eight prime ministers (well, eight-ish, seeing as one has resigned this month), not a formal statement signed by the parties. March 22, 2018    12.41pm Embarrassment for Vince Cable as liberal EU prime ministers disown his Brexit referendum claim Earlier the Lib Dems claimed that eight liberal EU prime ministers had signed a statement backing their call for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. (See 3.50pm.) It was an unusual statement, because prime ministers are usually loath to interfere in the internal affairs of other EU countries, and it seems as if the Lib Dems may have jumped the gun because the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - the liberal group in the European parliament, to which liberal PMs are attached - has now disowned the Lib Dem press release. Pertaining to the LibDem press release issued today on Brexit: at the ALDE leaders meeting of 22 March no statement has been agreed upon or released. March 22, 2018 As my colleague Jessica Elgot points out, the original press release also contained a mistake about the Slovenian prime minister. Miro Cerar has resigned as prime minister of Slovenia this month so does he count as one of the eight who signed, but didn't actually sign, the Lib Dem statement? March 22, 2018 On the plus side, that means that only seven PMs have retracted the original statement - not eight. But Vince Cable and his team have managed to upset the seven most powerful liberals in Europe. Not a great move ... Updated at 12.48pm EDT   12.26pm Dan Sabbagh Matt Hancock ’s busy day of media appearances continued with him speaking at a Press Gallery lunch. In a question and answer session, the culture secretary said “the system is not good enough” when asked if he was happy if the Cambridge Analytica stand-off. He hinted that he would grant the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, additional powers by introducing amendments to the data protection bill that would give her additional powers “to go in faster” once an investigation had begun and that the commissioner should be able to force individuals to give testimony. At present the commissioner’s powers only extend to companies, which means that former employees of Cambridge Analytica can avoid answering questions if they have quit a company under investigation for privacy breaches. When asked if it was time for the government to stop advertising on Facebook, the minister said “we haven’t gone there yet”. He argued that Facebook remained an effective form of communication despite the scandal. There was also a none too subtle side swipe against his opposite number Tom Watson, arguing that it was only the shadow culture secretary who “thinks it is a good idea to put Max Mosley in charge of regulating the Jewish Chronicle” - an inaccurate reference to the fact that Mosley’s charitable trust provides arm’s length funding to Impress, the only officially recognised press regulator. “Like most conspiracy theorists, when a real conspiracy theory comes along, he doesn’t take notice,” Hancock said. Other jokes were less controversial. Hancock said parliamentary business meant that he arrived late to last month’s annual Brit music awards after dinner had been served. The minister said he was sitting on the same table as Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood. Upon hearing of the minister’s hunger, the guitarist searched his bag for “a bit of a pick me up .... which turned out to be a Babybel for one of his daughters”.    Matt Hancock Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/Shutterstock    12.10pm Cambridge Analytica boss recalled to Commons culture committee to explain 'inconsistencies' in earlier evidence Alexander Hix, the suspended boss of Cambridge Analytica, has been summoned to give evidence for a second time to the Commons culture committee. In an open letter, the committee chairman Damian Collins said the MPs wanted to ask him about discrepancies between what he said in previous evidence and recent revelations about how Cambridge Analytica has exploited Facebook data. There were “a number of inconsistencies” in the evidence, Collins said. Giving “false statements” to a committee was “a very serious matter”, he added. . @CommonsCMS have recalled Alexander Nix to give evidence following recent reports in @guardian @nytimes and @Channel4News pic.twitter.com/nILljso1yV March 22, 2018    12.00pm A judge has given doctors permission to take blood samples from Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia so that tests can be carried out by chemical weapons experts, following a hearing in a specialist court, the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on: Mr Justice Williams has made a ruling following a hearing in the Court of Protection, where issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered, in London. He said both Mr and Ms Skripal were unconscious in hospital in Salisbury and therefore unable to give their consent to blood samples being taken or tested. The judge, who is based in the family division of the High Court in London, announced his decision today after analysing the case at a private hearing earlier this week.    11.50am 8 Liberal EU PMs back call for UK referendum on final Brexit deal Jessica Elgot Eight Liberal prime ministers from across Europe, almost a third of all EU members states, have signed a joint statement backing a referendum on the final Brexit deal, including Dutch leader Mark Rutte and Belgium’s Charles Michel . The prime ministers, who met Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable in Brussels ahead of the EU summit, said they would back any move to reverse Brexit and said the British public should be given the chance to vote on whatever deal Theresa May reaches with the EU. The statement was signed by Rutte and Michel as well as Luxembourg’s prime minister Xavier Bettel. The Czech Republic’s Andrej Babiš, Slovenia’s Miro Cerar, Denmark’s Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Estonia’s Jüri Ratas and Finland’s Juha Sipilä has also signed. The statement, issued shortly before May met EU leaders for a working dinner in Brussels ahead of Friday’s talks on the transition arrangement, said: We regret Brexit, but acknowledge the choice made by British voters for the UK government to negotiate withdrawal. We further acknowledge and support the Liberal Democrats’ call for the British people to have the final say on the Brexit deal. All parties need to seek a broad deal accommodating both the position of the UK government and the principles on which the European Union is built.

The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, is still waiting for a warrant. Photograph: Reuters The information commissioner will have to wait until at least Friday to enter the offices of Cambridge Analytica after a high court judge adjourned the hearing into her application for a warrant. The commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, announced on Monday that she planned to request an urgent warrant to enter the company’s London offices, after it was revealed that it had been given information from 50m Facebook profiles without users’ permission . According to a whistleblower, Cambridge Analytica used the data to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements. Denham told Channel 4 News that the company had failed to comply with her request for information, and that she wanted to access files and servers as part of an ongoing investigation into the use of personal data in political campaigns . Play Video 13:04 Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video A team of investigators who had already been sent into the building by Facebook were stood down, after the commissioner raised concerns that they could compromise her investigation. The information commissioner’s office (ICO) began the application process on Tuesday, but on Thursday it disclosed that it still did not have a warrant. In a statement on its website, it said: “A high court judge has adjourned the ICO’s application for a warrant relating to Cambridge Analytica until Friday. “The ICO will be in court to continue to pursue the warrant to obtain access to data and information to take forward our investigation.” The regulator refused to give any more information about the delay. On Thursday, the digital, culture, media and sport committee recalled Alexander Nix, ordering the Cambridge Analytica chief executive to give further testimony to the parliamentary inquiry into fake news. “Following material published in the UK Guardian, the New York Times and Channel 4 over the past few days, the committee would like to request that you supply further evidence,” the DCMS committee chair, Damian Collins, wrote. “There are a number of inconsistencies in your evidence to us,” Collins added, “notably your denial that your company received data from the Global Science Research company. We are also interested in asking you again about your claim that you ‘do not work with Facebook data, and … do not have Facebook data’.” Collins warned Nix that “giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter” and urged him to “explain” his comments. The London offices of Cambridge Analytica were evacuated for two hours on Thursday after reports of a suspicious package. Those based at the New Oxford Street headquarters were told to leave the offices and roads around it were closed. Police said they were called at 1.26pm GMT on Thursday 22 March to reports of a suspicious package. They said that the building was evacuated as a precaution and that no one was injured. On Tuesday, crates were seen being removed from the central London office that Cambridge Analytica shares with other tenants. No one on the scene would comment on the origin of the crates, and the ICO said it was not involved in their removal. At the same time, Cambridge Analytica said it had offered to let the ICO attend its office voluntarily, “subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection”. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, has hinted that the government will consider further strengthening the information commission’s powers to investigate the misuse of personal data. Hancock was responding to a Commons question from Labour’s Liam Byrne, who said it was “ludicrous that it has taken so long for her to get a search warrant for Cambridge Analytica’s offices, and it is ludicrous that people frustrating her investigations do not face jail for that frustration”. Hancock began by criticising Byrne for his “abrasive tone” and said “the data protection bill currently before parliament is all about strengthening this enforcement”. But he added: “If following evidence from this investigation we need to further strengthen those powers, then I am willing to consider that.” He also repeated previous responses by the government that there were no current contracts between government and the Cambridge Analytica group. Hancock later said “the system is not good enough” when asked if he was happy with the Cambridge Analytica stand off. He hinted that he would grant Denham additional powers by introducing amendments to the data protection bill that would give her additional powers “to go in faster” once an investigation had begun and that the commissioner should be able to force individuals to give testimony.

Your BuzzFeed News newsletter, March 22.  Posted on March 22, 2018, 11:50 GMT  Elamin Abdelmahmoud BuzzFeed News Reporter           This Facebook crisis just keeps getting bigger Good morning. It’s day six of Facebook’s data-harvesting scandal being the story, and it’s taken quite the turn: First of all: Mark Zuckerberg finally broke his silence . In a post, he said, “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.” He gave a timeline of the original data harvesting and how Facebook handled it. But remember: Facebook has also come under fire for its poor handling of the original incident. When it initially found out about the sale of the data to Cambridge Analytica, a violation of its rules, it only asked the company to “certify” it had deleted the data. Zuckerberg’s post leaves a lot of unanswered questions about what else Facebook could have done. Where’s Facebook’s board in all of this? They’re standing behind Zuckerberg and the company’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg. They sent us a statement that said Zuckerberg and Sandberg “have built the company and our business and are instrumental to its future.” Now there’s a lawsuit: A Maryland woman who claims she was frequently targeted with political ads is suing Facebook and Cambridge Analytica . She filed the suit over “the absolute disregard with which Defendants have chosen to treat Plaintiff’s Personal Information.” And finally (and this is big): Zuckerberg went on CNN last night to talk about this scandal. When the anchor asked why his company shouldn’t be regulated, his response was, “ I’m not sure we shouldn’t be regulated .” The Austin bomber made a 25-minute confession video before he died The man police believe was responsible for a string of lethal package bombs in Austin has died following a shootout with police that ended with him killing himself with an explosive device . After a pursuit along Interstate 35, police say 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt detonated an explosive device in his car as SWAT team officers approached on foot. One officer was injured by the blast. Conditt admitted to his crimes in a 25-minute video confession that he recorded the night before his death. Police are not releasing the video at this time, but describe it as “the outcry of a very challenged young man.” Trump is preparing to roll out a package of tariffs on China President Donald Trump is set to unveil $50 billion worth of tariffs targeted at Chinese imports. According to reports, the tariffs are in response to China’s theft of US intellectual property and technological know-how. US criticism of Chinese intellectual property theft is not new, but since he was a presidential candidate, Trump has vowed to take a particularly tough line on China. The move is likely to spark retaliation from Beijing. We totally get it. You don't have time to read the news. Don't sweat.

Quick catch-up Unarmed black man killed : Sacramento police shot and killed 22-year-old Stephon Clark in his own backyard.

Pottermore : J.K. Rowling's website for die-hard Harry Potter fans has fired the bulk of its editorial staff , raising questions about its future. The popular site was launched after the final Harry Potter film and was originally conceived as a way for Rowling to maintain and grow the online Potter fandom. Trump golf course : The Trump National Golf Club in New York is once again seeking permission to bring in foreign employees to work as servers and cooks, saying it can’t find Americans to do the jobs. 13 Reasons Why : The hit Netflix show is adding an anti-suicide warning video to its second season. The first season was criticized for its portrayal of teen suicide. Netflix’s vice-president said, “We didn’t know in Season 1 that the conversation was going to be this big.” A PR firm has been placing articles in conservative publications, sometimes without them knowing Conservative media spends a lot of time criticizing government overreach, whether it’s about gun control or taxation or climate change. But we came across an issue that’s a bit, let’s say, obscure: contact lens regulations. There have been many angry op-eds about the topic. One headline read, “Big brother is after your contact lenses.” Who cares that much about contact lens regulations? You might not, but big corporations like Costco and 1-800 Contacts sure do. A closer look into the authors of some of the wave of contact lens op-eds led us to a stealth corporate propaganda campaign, where a Washington, DC, public relations firm managed to place articles for its clients — often without the editors of the publications knowing.

During an interview with CNN, Zuckerberg said he was "really sorry that this happened." The interview aired hours after he and Facebook's No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, issued their first statements about the scandal . It was revealed last weekend that the British data firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately vacuumed up information from some 50 million Facebook users. Both Zuckerberg and Sandberg acknowledged "mistakes" on the part of Facebook, but for some of their critics, the remarks fell short. Facebook's stock has fallen 10% since Friday. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was "really sorry that this happened" Wednesday in his first interview on the massive data scandal that has roiled the social-media network this week. Zuckerberg made the apology on CNN hours after he and the company's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, issued their first public statements on the matter. The British data firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately used 50 million Facebook user profiles to target ads in support of its clients, including Donald Trump's successful 2016 US presidential campaign. In the CNN interview, Zuckerberg said he regretted taking Cambridge Analytica at its word when it signed a legal document in 2015 certifying that it had deleted the information from those profiles — but had not. "I don't know about you, but I'm used to when people legally certify that they are going to do something, that they do it," Zuckerberg said. "But I think this was clearly a mistake in retrospect." Advertisement He also said he was willing to testify to Congress on the matter, though he would prefer to send someone with "the most knowledge" on any lines of questioning. He said he was open to the idea of regulating tech and was in favor of legislation around transparency in online advertising. Cambridge Analytica is being scrutinized over its actions during the 2016 campaign after an executive with the firm was recorded boasting about the firm's ability to covertly target voters, entrap politicians, and launch propaganda campaigns. The reach of those operations was multiplied by connected platforms like Facebook. Russian operatives capitalized on this to a significant degree, sowing political discord among likely voters in a wide-ranging effort to meddle in the US election. Zuckerberg has acknowledged this in fits and starts after initially balking at the idea last year. He expressed some lingering disbelief of the concept on Wednesday night: "If you'd told me in 2004 when I was getting started with Facebook that a big part of my responsibility today would be to help protect the integrity of elections against interference by other governments, I wouldn't have really believed that that was gonna be something that I would have to work on 14 years later," Zuckerberg said.         Advertisement "But we're here now, and we're gonna make sure we're going to do a good job at it," he added. And while he said he was "sure someone's trying" to influence the 2018 midterm elections, he was also sure the company was better prepared to meet the challenge.

So has Big Tech's (more serious) efforts to prevent new and possibly sweeping regulation from Washington. Of course, Facebook has no one to blame but itself. Yes, Trump campaign contractor Cambridge Analytica was a dodgy actor who violated Facebook's terms of service and misused potentially tens of millions of Americans' data. But calling what happened a "data breach" isn't quite right. Facebook isn't Equifax. Its servers weren't hacked. And Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made numerous mistakes to bring the company to what is perhaps an existential crisis. He knows it, too. "We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you," he wrote in a statement, adding that "I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform. I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community." Part of the problem, and Zuck admits as much, is that app developers for too long had too much access to private user info. Back in 2015, the company should have demanded a forensic audit of all Cambridge Analytica machines. And Facebook's public response to this data privacy scandal has been wholly inadequate. The result is not just a big drop in Facebook's stock price, but real questions as to whether the brand can ever recover its previous shine. Yet while the immediate controversy is about Facebook and privacy, it is happening amid a broader "techlash" against the megaplatforms: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Even though these companies remain immensely popular among consumer and business users, activists on both the left ("You're monopolists who idiotically swung the election to President Trump!") and right ("You're monopolists who nefariously picked the evil side in the culture wars!") are seeking to rein them in through antitrust actions, regulation, or plain old demonization. When Zuckerberg eventually testifies before Congress, he won't just be arguing Facebook's case, but also the brief for why Big Tech can mostly fix itself without massive interference from Washington. And make no mistake: Risks are rising that Washington will act and perhaps overreact to tech's troubles. Consider what's at stake: When politicians talk about how the U.S. needs faster GDP growth, and workers need higher wages, what they are really saying is that the American economy needs to be more like Silicon Valley and the digital economy. Indeed, a new Commerce Department study finds the $1.3 trillion digital economy — including hardware, software, ecommerce, and digital media — grew at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent over the past decade compared to 1.5 percent growth in the overall economy. And the jobs being generated by all that growth tend to be good ones with average annual compensation of $114,000, nearly twice the U.S. average. Big Tech, with a combined market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion, has been at the sector's leading edge, generating growth and innovation in the internet economy. There's a reason why Europe laments its lack of tech titans, and China wants even more of their own. So, hey, let's not mess all that up with rash actions where unintended consequences haven't been carefully thought through. Some tech critics are, for instance, envious of Europe's big new rules scheme, the General Data Protection Regulation . The GDPR, which takes effect in May, sharply limits what companies can do with user data — such as advertising — without explicit consent through all manner of permission screens. Yet regulations can often turn into a blessing of sorts for big companies. What hurts short-term profits can sometimes turn into a long-term moat against potential future competitors. As tech analyst Ben Thompson explains, "GDPR will be a pain for Google and Facebook, but it will be lethal for many of their competitors, which means digital ad revenue post-GDPR … will go to Facebook and Google." Other Silicon Valley foes would make tech firms more liable for the content on their sites. They would scale back or even repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , which for more than 20 years has provided websites with immunity from liability for what their users post. This rule has been a key enabler of the rise of the internet economy. Weakening the provision would almost surely result in more litigation and censorship. And, again, less industry competition. "Even if today's internet giants can survive the loss of Section 230 and absorb the costs of censorship compliance, new market entrants likely can't," argues internet policy expert Mike Godwin. America's tech giants remain a tremendously valuable resource. And if they are to escape a potentially harmful regulatory reaction, they need to preemptively prepare for it. More transparency about data privacy probably isn't sufficient. One option is to back the idea that Congress establish special courts to deal with the needed economic and engineering expertise to adjudicate complaints against the platform companies. Maybe it could be a key platform of the Zuck for America 2020 campaign. Then again, better make that 2024. Or maybe 2028 ...   More Perspectives  Did Trump prove Obama wrong about America?
