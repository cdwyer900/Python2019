Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images Cambridge Analytica , the data firm at the centre of this year’s Facebook privacy row, is closing and starting insolvency proceedings. The company has been plagued by scandal since the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans and at least a million Britons had been harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing, but says that the negative media coverage has left it with no clients and mounting legal fees. Play Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer “Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers,” said the company in a statement , which also revealed that SCL Elections Ltd, the UK entity affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, would also close and start insolvency proceedings. “As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.” As first reported by the Wall Street Journal , the company has started insolvency proceedings in the US and UK. At Cambridge Analytica’s New York offices on an upmarket block on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, it appeared all the staff had already left the premises. The Guardian rang the doorbell to the company’s seventh-floor office and was met by a woman who would not give her name but said she did not work for the company.      The Cambridge Analytica office in New York. Photograph: Oliver Laughland for the Guardian Asked if anyone from Cambridge Analytica or SCL was still inside, she said: “They used to be. But they all left today.” The scandal centres around data collected from Facebook users via a personality app developed by the Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan . The data was collected via Facebook’s permissive “Graph API”, the interface through which third parties could interact with Facebook’s platform. This allowed Kogan to pull data about users and their friends, including likes, activities, check-ins, location, photos, religion, politics and relationship details. He passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, in breach of Facebook’s platform policies. Christopher Wylie, the original Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told the Observer that the data Kogan obtained was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election and Brexit. According to Wylie the data was fed into software that profiles voters and tries to target them with personalised political advertisements. Cambridge Analytica insists it never incorporated the Kogan data. Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach Read more Kogan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was being used as a scapegoat . He said: “My view is that I’m being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Honestly, we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately. We thought we were doing something that was really normal.” Cambridge Analytica said it had been “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas”. The CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was suspended in late March after Britain’s Channel 4 News broadcast secret recordings in which he claimed credit for the election of Donald Trump. He told an undercover reporter: “We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.” He also revealed that the company used a self-destruct email server to erase its digital history. “No one knows we have it, and secondly we set our … emails with a self-destruct timer … So you send them and after they’ve been read, two hours later, they disappear. There’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing.” Although Cambridge Analytica might be dead, the team behind it has already set up a mysterious new company called Emerdata . According to Companies House data, Alexander Nix is listed as a director along with other executives from SCL Group. The daughters of the billionaire Robert Mercer are also listed as directors. Damian Collins, chair of the British parliamentary committee looking into data breaches, expressed concern that Cambridge Analytica’s closure might hinder the investigation into the firm. “Cambridge Analytica and SCL group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing. The investigations into their work are vital,” he wrote on Twitter . The episode has shone a spotlight on the way that Facebook data is collected, shared and used to target people with advertising. The social network initially scrambled to blame rogue third parties for “platform abuse” – “the entire company is outraged we were deceived,” the company said – before it unveiled sweeping changes to its privacy settings and data sharing practices. “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” said Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post. “But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.” Cambridge Analytica: five key claims by academic at heart of scandal Read more Facebook first discovered that Kogan had shared data with Cambridge Analytica when a Guardian journalist contacted the company about it at the end of 2015 . It asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and revoked Kogan’s apps’ API access. However, Facebook relied on Cambridge Analytica’s word that it had done so. After it was revealed that the data hadn’t been deleted, Facebook revoked Cambridge Analytica’s access to its platform and launched an investigation of “thousands” of apps that had similar access and made several changes to restrict how much third-party developers can access from people’s profiles. The company also pledged to verify the identities of administrators of popular Facebook pages and advertisers buying political “issue” ads on “debated topics of national legislative importance” such as education, immigration and abortion.

DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images  Future Tense is a partnership of Slate , New America , and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.  Cambridge Analytica announced Wednesday that its parent group, SCL, has filed applications to begin insolvency proceedings in the UK and will be ceasing all operations. The political consulting firm is also planning to begin bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.  SCL’s founder Nigel Oakes first confirmed the news to the Wall Street Journal . The company reportedly made the decision because it was losing clients and has to pay soaring legal fees as a result of allegations that it improperly accessed Facebook data.  Gizmodo had reported earlier Wednesday that Cambridge Analytica’s U.S. employees abruptly discovered their offices were being shuttered on Wednesday and that they were told they would have to return their key cards immediately. Julian Wheatland, the chairman of the SCL Group who was supposed to take over as CEO of Cambridge Analytica, announced the decision during a conference call. He further informed staffers that the board thinks efforts to rebrand the company’s services would be “futile.”   Cambridge Analytica has been the focus of international scrutiny after the New York Times reported that it had improperly accessed private info from up to 87 million Facebook accounts and then used the cache Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. Channel 4 subsequently published an undercover investigation in which former CEO Alexander Nix is seen boasted of employing unscrupulous tactics to help clients win campaigns, such as using prostitutes to blackmail politicians.  The company nevertheless asserted its innocence in Wednesday’s announcement: Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.    This story is developing and we will update the post as we learn more.

The political research firm had been slammed in recent months for its data-gathering operation, which critics said violated the privacy of 87 million Facebook users. Fired CEO Alexander Nix was also recorded on a hidden camera suggesting the firm had bribed people for dirt on political candidates. “Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the firm said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica hired investigator Julian Malins to probe the allegations of wrongdoing, and said Wednesday that he concluded there was no wrongdoing. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story , said legal fees were one reason for the firm’s collapse. “Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by Mr. Malins’ report, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers,” the firm said. “As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.” Share this: 2016 presidential election Cambridge Analytica data breach donald trump facebook Share this article: Share this: Read Next 				Facebook engineer allegedly used 'privileged' access to st...

European data protection supervisor Giovanni Buttarelli said ‘controllers learn to talk a good game while continuing with the same old harmful habits’. Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters The European data protection supervisor has hit out at social media and tech firms over the recent constant stream of privacy policy emails in the run up to GDPR , calling them them the “sweatshops of the connected world”. With the tough new General Data Protection Regulations coming into force on 25 May, companies around the world are being forced to notify their users to accept new privacy policies and data processing terms to continue to use the services. But Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor (EDPS), lambasted the often-hostile approach of the recent deluge of notifications. “If this encounter seems a take-it-or-leave it proposition – with perhaps a hint of menace – then it is a travesty of at least the spirit of the new regulation, which aims to restore a sense of trust and control over what happens to our online lives,” said Buttarelli . “Consent cannot be freely given if the provision of a service is made conditional on processing personal data not necessary for the performance of a contract.” “The most recent [Facebook] scandal has served to expose a broken and unbalanced ecosystem reliant on unscrupulous personal data collection and micro-targeting for whatever purposes promise to generate clicks and revenues. “The digital information ecosystem farms people for their attention, ideas and data in exchange for so called ‘free’ services. Unlike their analogue equivalents, these sweatshops of the connected world extract more than one’s labour, and while clocking into the online factory is effortless it is often impossible to clock off.” What is GDPR? The European Union's new stronger, unified data protection laws, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will come into force on 25 May 2018, after more than six years in the making. GDPR will replace the current patchwork of national data protection laws, give data regulators greater powers to fine, make it easier for companies with a "one-stop-shop" for operating across the whole of the EU, and create a new pan-European data regulator called the European Data Protection Board. The new laws govern the processing and storage of EU citizens' data, both that given to and observed by companies about people, whether or not the company has operations in the EU. They state that data protection should be both by design and default in any operation. GDPR will refine and enshrine the "right to be forgotten" laws as the "right to erasure", and give EU citizens the right to data portability, meaning they can take data from one organisation and give it to another. It will also bolster the requirement for explicit and informed consent before data is processed, and ensure that it can be withdrawn at any time. To ensure companies comply, GDPR also gives data regulators the power to fine up to €20m or 4% of annual global turnover, which is several orders of magnitude larger than previous possible fines. Data breaches must be reported within 72 hours to a data regulator, and affected individuals must be notified unless the data stolen is unreadable, ie strongly encrypted. Was this helpful?  Thank you for your feedback. While data protection and privacy has become a hot-button issue in part thanks to the Cambridge Analytica files , Buttarelli is concerned that it is simply being used as part of the “PR toolkit” of firms. He said that there is “a growing gulf between hyperbole and reality, where controllers learn to talk a good game while continuing with the same old harmful habits”. A new social media subgroup of data protection regulators will be convened in mid-May to tackle what Buttarelli called the “manipulative approaches” that must change with GDPR. “Brilliant lawyers will always be able to fashion ingenious arguments to justify almost any practice. But with personal data processing we need to move to a different model,” said Buttarelli. “The old approach is broken and unsustainable – that will be, in my view, the abiding lesson of the Facebook/ Cambridge Analytica case.” MPs threaten Mark Zuckerberg with summons over Facebook data  GDPR  Data protection Privacy Europe European Union Google            Most viewed    World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Cities Global development    jobs make a contribution subscribe guardian labs about us work for us contact us advertise with us help terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop complaints & corrections all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter digital newspaper archive © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The closure comes more than a month after the company suspended CEO Alexander Nix following a report alleging that the firm used bribery and prostitution to entrap politicians in compromising situations. The firm also launched a probe to determine if it had engaged in wrongdoing. Business Insider reported in March that some major players behind Cambridge Analytica have created a new company with Nix as its director and U.S. businessman, and staunch Trump supporter Erik Prince as chairman. Citing public filings at Britain's Companies House, the company, Emerdata, was incorporated last August, per Business Insider. The company's mission is unclear.

Consider the yellow journalism of the Hearst era or the propaganda pamphlets of World War II.But with the rise of the internet and social media, the spread of this misinformation and disinformation has increased dramatically. Perhaps the most visible case occurred during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. All key U.S. intelligence agencies agree that during that time Russian actors sowed chaos on social media. Science correspondent Miles O’Brien and series producer Cameron Hickey have been researching junk news on the internet since the election, uncovering important storylines close to home. This culminates in a four-part PBS NewsHour series on junk news. (Part Two airs on Wednesday’s PBS NewsHour.) In the first segment , Miles took us inside the Facebook headquarters. We learned, in broad strokes, how Facebook’s News Feed algorithm works and how it ranks stories and posts to fit its users’ preferences. The segment also explored the potential downsides of exploiting the attention economy. The second segment, airing Wednesday, is a profile of Cyrus Massoumi, who publishes loads of clickbait and distributes it to a large audience. Cameron Hickey found Massoumi by building software to track the spread of junk news. While reporting, we found more interesting facts, stories and tangents than could ever fit into four Leading Edge segments. The good news is you can catch the full experience on Miles’ podcast, Miles To Go . Junk news podcasts President Barack Obama, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, holds a town hall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, April 20, 2011. Official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson To learn how Facebook sorts posts, Miles sat down with Dan Zigmond , head of analytics for Facebook’s News Feed. Zigmond describes the company’s opaque method of sorting stories on the News Feed and then surfacing them for its 2 billion monthly active users. — In another podcast, Miles turns to danah boyd , a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and the founder of Data & Society, for a history of misinformation on the web. danah believes the origins of modern junk news can be traced to when Oprah Winfrey was trolled in 2008 . — Photo by Snopes.com In another episode of Miles To Go, Miles talks to Brooke Binkowski , managing editor of the famous fact-checking website Snopes.com, about the challenges of tracking junk news, and about her company’s recent partnership with Facebook. — After the Cambridge Analytica data leak scandal, Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify before Congress and grilled on Facebook’s perceived lack of user data protection. On this special “Hash It Out” edition of Miles To Go , Miles O’Brien Productions editor Brian Truglio and I ask the question: Is Facebook’s ad-driven business model fundamentally incompatible with personal data protection? — Image by Fedor Kossakovski How much junk news existed on Facebook during the 2016 U.S. presidential election? Who created it and how did it spread? Miles interviewed Jonathan Albright , data journalist and research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, on the subject. Albright’s research into how information flows through networks allowed him to map how Russian actors spread disinformation through the internet. — And finally, who creates junk news? Why do they do it? Go behind the scenes, as Miles sits down with Cyrus Massoumi , publisher of the liberal junk news site TruthExaminer. We find out how Massoumi got into the business of clickbait, and how it has netted him a small fortune. Miles To Go is available on milesobrien.com , iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts.

Trump’s presidential campaign. The decision was made less than two months after Cambridge Analytica and Facebook became embroiled in a data-harvesting scandal that compromised the personal information of up to 87 million people. Revelations about the misuse of data, published in March by The New York Times and The Observer of London, plunged Facebook into crisis and prompted regulators and lawmakers to open investigations into Cambridge Analytica. In a statement posted to its website , Cambridge Analytica said the controversy had driven away virtually all of the company’s customers, forcing it to file for bankruptcy in both the United States and Britain. The elections division of Cambridge’s British affiliate, SCL Group, will also shut down, the company said. But the company’s announcement left several questions unanswered, including who would retain the company’s intellectual property — the so-called psychographic voter profiles built in part with data from Facebook — and whether Cambridge Analytica’s data-mining business would return under new auspices. “Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the company’s statement said. Cambridge Analytica also said the results of an independent investigation it had commissioned, which it released on Wednesday , contradicted assertions made by former employees and contractors about its acquisition of Facebook data. The report played down the role of a contractor turned whistle-blower, Christopher Wylie, who helped the company acquire Facebook data, calling it “very modest.” Cambridge Analytica did not reply to requests for comment. The news of Cambridge ceasing operations was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo . The company, bankrolled by Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who invested at least $15 million, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Those modeling techniques underpinned Cambridge Analytica’s work for the Trump campaign and for other candidates in 2014 and 2016. But Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny over the past year, first for its purported methods of profiling voters and then over allegations that it improperly harvested private data from Facebook users. Last year, the company was drawn into the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The company was also forced to suspend its chief executive , Alexander Nix, after a British television channel released an undercover video . In it, Mr. Nix suggested that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections. Facebook has since announced changes to its policies for collecting and handling user data. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testified last month before Congress, where he faced criticism for failing to protect users’ data. The controversy dealt a major blow to Cambridge Analytica’s ambitions of expanding its commercial business in the United States, while also bringing unwanted attention to the American government contracts sought by SCL Group, an intelligence contractor. Besides working for the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica was previously hired by the political action committee founded by John R. Bolton, the national security adviser. It had also worked for the 2016 presidential campaigns of Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz. But no candidates for federal office in the United States have disclosed paying Cambridge Analytica during the 2018 cycle. A Republican congressional candidate in California did report voiding a $10,000 transaction with the company in early March, according to federal election records. The company also unsuccessfully tried to court some major commercial clients in the last year, including Mercedes-Benz and Anheuser-Busch InBev, the global brewer, according to one former employee. Cambridge pitched AB InBev by claiming that it could position Bud Light as the beer for the young party crowd and Budweiser for old-school conservatives, according to the former employee, who asked not to be named because the person was restricted from speaking about the company’s business. In recent months, executives at Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group, along with the Mercer family, have moved to created a new firm , Emerdata, based in Britain, according to British records. The new company’s directors include Johnson Ko Chun Shun, a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince. Mr. Prince founded the private security firm Blackwater, which was renamed Xe Services after Blackwater contractors were convicted of killing Iraqi civilians. Cambridge and SCL officials privately raised the possibility that Emerdata could be used for a Blackwater-style rebranding of Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group, according two people with knowledge of the companies, who asked for anonymity to describe confidential conversations. One plan under consideration was to sell off the combined company’s data and intellectual property. An executive and a part owner of SCL Group, Nigel Oakes, has publicly described Emerdata as a way of rolling up the two companies under one new banner. Efforts to reach him by phone on Wednesday were unsuccessful. The former Cambridge Analytica employee said that staff members were originally told there would be an all-hands meeting in London on Tuesday, but that it was pushed back a day. Then, after assembling at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, they were kept waiting through the morning and much of the afternoon before Julian Wheatland, the company’s chief executive, delivered the news. The damage to the company’s reputation was simply too severe, and it was “futile” and “pointless” to try to rebuild amid investigations in the United States and Britain, Mr. Wheatland said, according to the former Cambridge Analytica employee, who was informed by those in attendance. Employees in Washington were notified during a conference call later in the day. They were then told to turn over their identification cards and any company property and to go home. By 2 p.m., Cambridge Analytica offices on Pennsylvania Avenue were empty save for a single man, who refused to answer questions from a reporter. Ben Protess and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.

As the EU’s independent data protection authority, the European Data Protection Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that organisations comply with GDPR rules when the legislation enters into force on 25 May. However, in an editorial anticipating the launch of the legislation, Buttarelli warned that for some companies, efforts to mine user data would continue unabated. In particular, he highlighted changes to the privacy policies of a number of large companies in an attempt to ensure that they comply with GDPR. In many cases, users are told that they must agree to new terms, or they will be unable to use free services. However, Buttarelli expressed concern that in agreeing to these new privacy policies or terms and conditions, users are also agreeing to share their data in much the way they have already been, and in ways that GDPR aims to address. What did Buttarelli say? The European Data Protection Supervisor drew attention to the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, and suggested that many companies could continue operating in the same way following the implementation of GDPR. He explained: ‘The most recent scandal has served to expose a broken and unbalanced ecosystem reliant on unscrupulous personal data collection and micro-targeting for whatever purposes promise to generate clicks and revenues.’ The aim of GDPR is to secure the right of EU citizens to privacy, Buttarelloi went on, but many companies are updating their terms of conditions to provide legal cover for potentially unethical activities. He said: ‘Companies whose business model depends on tracking are now asking their customers to say whether they agree to, for example, the use of sensitive data and data from outside sources… People feel pushed towards clicking ‘I accept’.’ Buttarelli concluded: ‘If you object to being tracked in exchange for the ‘free’ services on which many of which our lives now depend, then the only alternative is to pay. But the fundamental right to privacy and related freedoms like free speech and non-discrimination apply to all, they cannot be the exclusive privilege of those who can afford to pay.’ LinkedIn Twitter Facebook  START MK SPECIAL REPORT AUTHOR END MK SPECIAL REPORT AUTHOR START MK RELATED PARTNER PROFILE END MK RELATED PARTNER PROFILE START MK RELATED POSTS END MK RELATED PARTNER PROFILE START MK RELATED SPECIAL REPORTS END MK RELATED SPECIAL REPORTS START MK RELATED EBOOKS END MK RELATED EBOOKS consumer protection cybersecurity GDPR /.post RELATED ARTICLES MORE FROM AUTHOR  Commission proposes to modernise and digitalise EU civil judicial co-operation ./td-related-span4 EU budget: reinforcing Europe’s cultural and creative sectors ./td-related-span4 EU to provide funding to support migrants and refugees in Africa ./td-related-span4 ./row-fluid  EU launches proposal to modernise cohesion policy investments ./td-related-span4 EU awards €5m for projects celebrating European cultural heritage ./td-related-span4 PROFILE: How can we prevent online child sexual abuse in the workplace? ./td-related-span4 ./row-fluid ./block LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

These are external links and will open in a new window  Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal  Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy at the centre of the Facebook data-sharing scandal, is shutting down. The firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients. According to Facebook, data about up to 87 million of its members was harvested by a quiz app and then passed on to the political consultancy. The social network said its own probe into the matter would continue. "This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again," said a spokesman. "We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities." What are the accusations against Cambridge Analytica? The company has been accused of using the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica In March, Channel 4 aired undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix, giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps. The UK-based company, which denies any wrongdoing, has an extensive record of working abroad on many election campaigns, including in Italy, Kenya and Nigeria. Why does it say it is shutting? Clarence Mitchell, a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica, referred the BBC to a statement on the firm's website . "Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas," it said. "Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers. "As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business." Zuckerberg faces formal summons from MPs Was Facebook data's value 'literally nothing'? 'Facebook in PR crisis mode' ' The statement added that its parent company SCL Elections was also commencing bankruptcy proceedings.  The sting in the tail By the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, in California When the news of Cambridge Analytica's demise broke here at Facebook's F8 developer conference, it is safe to say few tears were shed. The scandal over data misuse has been a crisis not just for Facebook but for the thousands of external developers whose access to data has been curbed in response to the affair. But if they were tempted to celebrate there was a sting in the tail in the political consultancy's statement. It claimed that what it did was not only legal but was standard practice in the world of online advertising. That rang true to some people in this world and there may be more evidence of such practices as Facebook continues its audit of apps. Cambridge Analytica may be gone but as more stones are lifted there may be more unpleasant surprises to come about the use and misuse of personal data. Is this the end? The UK's Financial Times newspaper says it has spoken to another ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica, on condition of anonymity, who said they were sure the company would emerge "in some other incarnation or guise". The Observer journalist whose investigation first exposed the data privacy scandal has suggested that the public remain sceptical. Report The chair of a UK parliament committee investigating the firm's activities also raised concerns about Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections' move. "They are party to very serious investigations and those investigations cannot be impeded by the closure of these companies," said Damian Collins MP. "I think it's absolutely vital that the closure of these companies is not used as an excuse to try and limit or restrict the ability of the authorities to investigate what they were doing." Report What action had it taken already? Cambridge Analytica's chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended in March after the Channel 4 News footage was aired. Last month, Cambridge Analytica said it had only licensed 30 million records belonging to US citizens from the quiz app's creator Dr Aleksandr Kogan, and that they had not been used in the US presidential election. The firm added that it had since deleted all the information despite claims to the contrary by others. Who funded Cambridge Analytica? One of Cambridge Analytica's major investors is the US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He is said to have put $15m (£11m) into the business, according to the Guardian. Mr Mercer, a former computer scientist, is also a major donor to the US Republican Party and helped support Donald Trump's election campaign. He has never given an interview about his political views and is not thought to have commented publicly about the data-harvesting scandal. What is the Brexit link? Earlier on Wednesday, a cyber-security specialist presented evidence to the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Chris Vickery linked SCL and Cambridge Analytica to AggregateIQ - a Canadian data analytics firm, which Facebook has also suspended from using its platform . He added that "beyond a shadow of a doubt" AggregateIQ had been involved in "some form of collaboration or co-ordination" between various pro-Brexit groups during the UK's EU referendum campaign. AIQ denies ever being part of Cambridge Analytica, its parent company SCL or accessing improperly obtained Facebook data. And representatives from Vote Leave and Leave.EU have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. But the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office are conducting their own investigations into the Canadian firm's operations. The ICO has also issued a statement about Cambridge Analytica's closure. "The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to pursue individuals and directors as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating," it said. "We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded."

The company, which worked on the Brexit campaign, sustained severe criticism after harvesting the data from millions of Facebook profiles. The move comes in the wake of rising legal costs in the Facebook investigation, and the loss of clients following revelations about the firm in March. Cambridge Analytica commence insolvency proceedings and release results of independent investigation: https://t.co/BeDLpU1gIh — Cambridge Analytica (@CamAnalytica) May 2, 2018 In a statement, the company said it had been “vilified” for legal activities that are a “standard component” of advertising in the political world. Up to 87 million people had data harvested by an app which was then acquired by Cambridge Analytica (CA), according to Facebook. The app, a personality survey called “yourdigitallife”, collected personal data from users and their Facebook friends, in line with the behaviour of many similar apps at the time. It allowed CA to tailor specific political adverts to small groups of people, already knowing what their likes and interests were, it is alleged. CA played a key role in mapping out the behaviour of voters in the run-up to the 2016 US election and was also used during the EU referendum campaign earlier that year. Cambridge Analytica and SCL group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing. The investigations into their work are vital — Damian Collins (@DamianCollins) May 2, 2018 In a statement, CA said: “Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas. “Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by Mr Malins’ report [independent investigator Julian Malins], the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company’s customers and suppliers. “As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.” A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “The ICO has been investigating the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica as part of a wider investigation into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns, social media companies and others. “We will be examining closely the details of the announcements of the winding down of Cambridge Analytica and the status of its parent company. “The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to pursue individuals and directors as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating. “We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded.”   redesign ResponsiveArticleDisplayComments      standard BlockMegaNewsMostPopular Most popular Most commented Tab panes Loading...

Chris Vickery, director of cyber risk research at cyber-security company UpGuard, told MPs he had found details of how AIQ carried out work for Brexit campaign groups VoteLeave, the DUP, Veterans for Britain and Change Britain. Giving evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, he said: “I would conclude beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was some sort of collaboration going on. “With all the evidence that I’ve seen, I don’t think there’s any ability for a reasonable, rational person to deny that there was some level of collaboration or co-ordination going on between the pro-Brexit campaigns.” The revelations about AIQ’s work, which Mr Vickery submitted to the inquiry as evidence, went as far as showing the technical tools the company used to help political campaigns but not the precise details of how they were applied, he said. In addition, Mr Vickery said he had no evidence of activity by campaign representatives, only that of developers working for AIQ.

While investigating CA’s parent company Mr Vickery said he found a repository of tools which he said could help the users better target individuals with advertising on social media. “It hit me that this is the repository of tools for Aggregate IQ and it looks like Cambridge Analytica and (parent company) SCL are using the source code behind the scripts,” he said. While he could not prove collaboration across Brexit campaigns outright, he said the tools were open and available to anyone with an internet connection access and apply in their work. “It would be a smart way to do it if you wanted to collaborate and have plausible deniability,” he added. Representatives from Vote Leave, Leave.EU, Aggregate IQ and Cambridge Analytica have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Although Breitbart UK launched in the build up to the EU Referendum Mr Vickery said he had not found any mention of the website’s British arm. Former special adviser to President Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, was also a former executive chairman of Breitbart and a co-founder of Cambridge Analytica.

Following the far-reaching scandal over Facebook user data, Cambridge Analytica has confirmed that it is shutting down. The political research firm with ties to the Donald Trump campaign has been caught up in a whirlwind of controversy about data collection and privacy allegations in recent weeks.

Cambridge Analytica deny any wrongdoing, but say the negative media coverage of the  led to its closure.

The British firm was accused of improperly using the Facebook data from 87 million people, including 45,000 in Ireland, to influence elections. In a statement, Cambridge Analyica says it's "immediately ceasing all operations" and blamed a "siege of media coverage" for driving away nearly all of its clients.

The company says this decision "was extremely painful" for Cambridge Analytica and its employees, "who learned today that they likely would be losing their jobs". The firm's filed applications to begin insolvency proceedings in the UK, with bankruptcy proceedings beginning soon in the US.

Image: Facebook Simple Share Buttons Adder (6.1.5) simplesharebuttons.com googleon: all From dating to a Clear History feature, the business of innovation goes on at Facebook. Last night (1 May) at F8, Facebook’s developer shindig, everyone expected to see an embattled and defensive company shook to the core by the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. “This has been an intense year – I can’t believe we are only four months in,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg joked with developers. ‘Cambridge Analytica was a major breach of trust. We need to make sure this never happens again’ – MARK ZUCKERBERG But, much like how South Korean tech giant Samsung bounced back from the Note7 exploding phone debacle, you got the sense that Facebook intends to come bounding off the battlefield, a little bruised but a lot wiser. Or, to paraphrase Churchill, when you are going through hell, just keep going. And hellish it has been. UK MPs are threatening Zuckerberg with a formal summons if he doesn’t appear before their committee to explain what Facebook does with data, and the timing of WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum’s departure in an apparent clash over privacy and encryption is also awkward. Nonchalant, Zuckerberg pressed on and emphasised the company’s mission. “We are all here because we are optimistic about the future. There are real challenges to address and we have to keep that sense of optimism.” He outlined that the company has a broader sense of responsibility and that he wants to see the platform used for good. “We’ve seen the #MeToo movement and marches organised on Facebook,” Zuckerberg said, adding that it is important for developers to keep building meaningful new services. “The hard part was figuring out how to move forward on everything else we need to do. We had to ask ourselves, what would the world lose if Facebook disappeared? “People. Our relationships matter most. This is our DNA. We’ve come a long way, but it surprises me how little … our industry puts people first. Phones are designed around apps and that’s not how people think. “Part of the solution will be that one day, more of our tech will need to focus on people and our relationships. There is no guarantee that we will get this right. This is hard stuff. We will make mistakes that will have consequences.” And so, Zuckerberg went on to reveal a set of innovations that not only showed where the company was going as a business, it also revealed just what you can do with a 2.2bn-strong community. So, what did we learn? 1. Facebook is going into dating, watch out Tinder! Facebook chief product officer Chris Cox on stage at F8. Image: Facebook “Is there any industry Facebook won’t try to take over?” That was the view of one young entrepreneur I spoke to last night when he heard Facebook was going into the dating business. Zuckerberg said: “This is going to be for building long-term relationships, not hook-ups.” But the implication is clear: Facebook is going into dating and Tinder could join the media industry and a slew of other business verticals that Facebook will simply stomp on to feed its revenue-hungry machine, which recorded almost $12bn in sales in the most recent quarter. “One in three marriages happen online,” Zuckerberg quipped and said that people he meets point at their kids and say ‘thank you’ to him. “We know we are making positive differences in people’s lives but we haven’t built features to help people find partners. Today, we are announcing a set of new features coming soon around dating.” Unsurprisingly, Match Group, owner of Tinder and OkCupid, saw its stock plummet by more than 17pc when the news was announced. The way the Facebook dating system will work is that users’ friends won’t see their dating profile and they will only be suggested to people who are not their friends. The drive to connect people will be community-focused and will be anchored around events you are going to and groups that you are part of. An unlocking feature will let users of the dating platform make their profile visible to other attendees or events or members of groups. It’s hard to see how this will turn out but there is a certain method to the madness as it creates a context that is more focused than blind dates, and less cold than the swipe-left culture of Tinder. Not sure how I feel about Facebook – which often feels like a multi-generational family dinner party – as a matchmaker or wingman, but the future is unstoppable. 2. Facebook wants to protect election integrity Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook was slow to identify Russian interference during the US election race. “We expected traditional attacks and didn’t expect these coordinated attacks and large networks of accounts we weren’t aware of. “We will never be unprepared for this again. We have AI tools that took down thousands of fake accounts that we traced back to Russia and had taken back their network.” In recent weeks, Facebook revealed a View Ads feature as part of an effort to make political ads more transparent. “We want you to be able to see who is running these ads, what other messages they are sending, and have this at a higher standard than TV ads or anything else on the network. “By the end of this year, we will have 20,000 people working on security.” As well as these, and AI tools to remove fake accounts or real accounts spreading hoaxes, Facebook will double down on more accurate news, bringing on more and more fact-checking providers. 3. Privacy is Facebook’s new mantra “Cambridge Analytica was a major breach of trust. We need to make sure this never happens again.” This was expected to be the awkward part of F8, where developers would find new restrictions on data that could be shared from apps to be unpalatable. However, judging from the stream from the auditorium at least, Zuckerberg’s musings on privacy were broadly welcomed by developers who want to build serious businesses and services. He said that compared with 2014, there has been a major change on the platform to prevent the sharing of people’s friends’ information and that Facebook has restricted all kinds of data from being shared. “There is more we can do. We need to find other bad apps that are out there. If we find anything suspicious, we will bring in independent auditors and tell anyone whose data might be affected. “With the onset of GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation], we will be asking everyone to review their privacy controls.” To developers, he said: “We will be putting in stronger protections that will give you more ability to keep building for the long term.” And that’s the key message from F8: developers need certainty that they can continue to build apps and future businesses on the Facebook platform. 4. Facebook’s Clear History will be the biggest update to the platform One of the biggest concerns people had about Facebook was its ability to collect data about users whether they used the platform or not, by being able to access their web browsing history and, in turn, sell targeted ads. At F8, Zuckerberg announced that for the first time, users can opt out of this data collection method. It revealed a new Clear History feature that allows users to delete their browsing data from Facebook’s servers or ask the company not to collect it at all. It essentially erases data that describes what other sites they have visited. You can consider this new feature to be a direct result of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal whereby up to 87m people were affected by an app’s ability to gather data on Facebook users without their permission. It is a big leap of faith for Facebook itself because it will impact the amount of data that the social network will be able to collect about its users to drive targeted ads. But, in terms of restoring trust, it is potentially a step in the right direction. 5. Facebook is moving into real-time translation on Messenger This is a game-changer. Until now, the translation game has been dominated by Google and Microsoft on their respective platforms. Microsoft has a sweetheart deal with Huawei that has resulted in a real-time, AI-based translation app on devices such as the Mate 10 Pro and the P20. Last night at F8, Facebook revealed that it will be rolling out chat translation within Messenger. The service will start slowly with just English-Spanish conversions for users in the US who start a conversation through Facebook Marketplace. However, in the coming weeks, all US Messenger users will get access and, over time, it will launch in additional languages and countries. This is a pivotal move for Facebook and could be the glue that will make Messenger stick, cementing its role as the nemesis for SMS. It is worth wondering if this translation AI will make its way over to WhatsApp, too. 6. Facebook is an AI powerhouse Zuckerberg’s love for AI has been well documented but there was no mention of his personal robot butler that he wants to build. However, we have learned that as well as more than 200,000 active developers focused on Messenger, there are 300,000 active bots – up from 100,000 last year – that facilitate 8bn messages between people and businesses every month. That is up 400pc on last year. The head of Messenger, David Marcus, also revealed that Facebook is planning to bring augmented reality (AR) apps to Messenger in what could also be a game-changer for marketers and e-commerce players. 7. Facebook’s $3bn bet on VR is about to pay off big time We also learned that the Oculus Go virtual reality (VR) headset that Facebook wants to bring to the mainstream is available for purchase at $199. The VR headset is a standalone device, meaning it doesn’t require a high-end smartphone or an expensive high-powered PC to make it work. The key difference is that the device has no wires or cables, and users simply take it out of the box and switch it on and become immersed in the VR or AR world. This quintessentially addresses the problem that has prevented VR from going mainstream – all the messing with wires or the need for high-end compute power. The $199 price point is attractive but the ball is in Facebook’s court to market it and make it mainstream. Ever since Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014 for $3bn, there have been question marks over the future of VR and whether it was just another Zuckerberg hobby horse. But, judging by the positive reviews coming out of Silicon Valley, the Oculus Go may see that bet pay off. 8. Speaking of hardware, Facebook has more tricks up its sleeve A decade ago, Amazon’s foray into hardware with the Kindle was amusing at first and then it became a serious hardware player, with devices such as the Fire tablet and, most notably, the Alexa-powered Echo. Google is quite similar with its range of Pixel smartphones and Chrome media devices, not to mention AI speakers and, soon, self-driving cars. But what is Facebook up to? Well, as we have seen with Oculus Go, Facebook has begun to discover its mojo in hardware terms – and it won’t stop with VR. Facebook is understood to be considering launching its own smart speakers, starting internationally rather than in the US. The two speakers are understood to include a voice assistant that is based on the same underlying technology that powered Facebook’s M chatbot, which was discontinued in January. One will come with a camera and touchscreen and will connect directly to Facebook Messenger. Both will come equipped with an AI-powered smart voice assistant tied to the M AI engine. (Take a close cue from what Facebook is doing with its aforementioned translation AI system.) These are effectively going to be Facebook’s answer to the Amazon Echo and Alphabet’s Google Home products. Zuckerberg et al might be cleverly about to kick-start a new epoch in terms of global communication and cross-border commerce. And at its heart?

If you think about it, though, the question is like a self-basting turkey, a self-saucing pudding. It answers itself. Why wouldn't you use Facebook for online dating? At Facebook's annual developer conference in California, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the company was creating a dating app that would sit inside a Facebook user's profile, that could help the 200 million single Facebook users have "hook-ups" and/or "long-term relationships".  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announces his plan to become a cyber matchmaker.  DAVID PAUL MORRIS The dating page wouldn't be visible to the Facebook user's friends and family, and Facebook wouldn't try to set friends up with each other. It would just use what it knows about people, to get them together. Advertisement Related Quotes  5 years 1 Day Last updated: Last updated:   ASX Announcements   It's brilliant. Terribly perfect I mean, why wouldn't you entrust your sex life to a company so cavalier with the privacy of its users, it estimates that all of the data of all of its users has probably already been hoovered up by any number of nefarious players? Why wouldn't you want to use the services of a company so steeped in fake news and "dark advertising", the UK government has threatened to force Mr Zuckerberg to testify about his company's role in the UK decision to leave the EU, the next time he sets foot on UK soil?  Facebook's business practices may well prove to be monumentally catastrophic for democracy and for humanity as a whole, but who cares?! Those very practices will make perfect tools for anyone looking for love, or looking to get their end away on a slow Sunday afternoon. Just think about Tinder for moment, or any of the other online dating services. What's the first thing you do after you match with someone on those services? You stalk them on Facebook. So why not just cut out the middle man, and let Facebook do the stalking for you? Weaponised creepiness It will already know everything there is to know about your potential date, not just from his or her Facebook profile and the Facebook profiles of everyone he or she has ever come into contact with, but also from other sources that have nothing to do with Facebook, such as people's mobile phones. Remember, the company creates dossiers known as "shadow profiles" on everyone, whether they are Facebook users or not. The dossiers contains data hoovered out of the contacts databases of people installing the Facebook app, and can include all of the email addresses, all of the phone numbers and all of the addresses of everyone in the contacts database, whether those people are Facebook users or not, whether they agreed to the data collection or not. And, as was revealed during a data leak in 2013 , when shadow profiles were accidentally mixed with official Facebook profiles, Facebook matches its shadow profiles with its users' official profiles, collecting far more data on them than they ever agreed to. It's as creepy a practice as you can imagine, and it's just waiting to be weaponised for online dating. Phone numbers? Places of work? Parent's address? Facebook has everything you ever wanted to know about your prospective date, but were too civilised to ask. Data leaks And if Facebook won't give it to you as part of some premium dating option, just wait for it to leech out some other way, through some other Facebook front door. Never forget, the data that formed the basis of the Cambridge Analytica scandal wasn't hacked from Facebook servers. There was no breach.  Facebook positively allowed the data to be gathered, and only discouraged  its use for evil by attaching a Terms of Service. To put that in dating terms, Facebook's approach to user privacy is something like this: Here's your date's home address. Please don't use it. And the best thing about Facebook's dating service is, creepy stalking and privacy invasions are the very least of what this social network has to offer. Dark ads, sponsored posts that are only ever seen by a narrowly defined target demographic, are where Facebook's true dating potential lies. #FakeLove Many of us are learning about the scale and power of dark ads only now, as Facebook's role in the election of Donald Trump, in Brexit, in scam advertising  and in social unrest around the world is being investigated and litigated. But web marketers and security agencies looking for regime change have known about them for years. Facebook allows advertisers to create content, post it on Facebook, and hide it from the very people the content is about, the people who might happen to know the content is false. The content can be so demographically targeted, it's only ever seen by a handful of people, so its truth never gets tested in public discourse until it's too late. It's a perfect tool for dating. Looking to make yourself more eligible? Looking to go on dates with a fellow dog lover? Why not try one of Facebook's special headlines . . . Perth's Richest Woman is Looking For Love! (Sponsored) Sydney Man Breaks World Record for Rescuing Dogs!! (Sponsored) Who cares if the story is true or not? Not Facebook, and not any of your family or friends. They will never see it. Only the people who match your dating profile will, as part of their feed so it looks like news. After all, the tactic has worked countless times before, and on a scale much larger than one on one relationships. If Facebook can get Donald Trump elected to president, there is nobody it can't get a date. Nobody.    Share     Latest Stories   If Asset's byline is not empty, show byline. Otherwise show related author list.   If Asset's byline is not empty, show byline.

The rise of the 'duvet day' has been spurred on by employers who recognize mental health awareness in the workplace Shocking number of employees work when mentally unwell Despite the best efforts of organizations, employees are still keeping schtum when it comes to their own internal battles The increasing importance of data in organizations has spun through the business world and landed firmly at HR’s feet. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal through to the impact of GDPR on client lists, any and all businesses need to sit up and take responsibility for the ethical handling of their data lists. One man who knows the importance of HR’s role in data regulation is Roberto Maranca - a leading Chief Data Officer who’s worked for the likes of Lloyds and GE Capital. We caught up with him to talk through the growing relevance of the people function in the emerging world of data. “Data and HR is an incredibly powerful combination,” prefaced Maranca. “If you look at what’s causing CEOs and CIOs sleepless nights, it’s their data. Everyone wants to do more with data – wants better insights, more predictability, more agility. “And yet, if you consider what’s affecting leaders’ ability to become more proficient with data, it’s not technology: luckily, there’s an app for everything nowadays. There’s always something out there that’s able to efficiently solve your conundrum – whatever it may be. Tech’s not the issue, it’s the internal culture of companies. Data is nothing but a huge monumental change problem and it’s a change of lifestyle for the majority of corporations.” These key data professionals need to be more combative at implementing change, according to Maranca. He went on to compare the new data ecosystem as an organ that needs to be transplanted into the complex body of modern business. “The operation is tricky even if you’re purely looking at the technological fabric of the company and not taking into consideration people’s natural fear of change that acts like antibodies and rejects the new,” continued Maranca. “cleaning data is a very tedious job, and most firms have quite a bit of backlog, though as leaders of this change we ought to find a way to make such programs something employees want to be a part of; looking to the future with curiosity and hope rather than anxiety.” The two groups of HR and Data need to work much closer together. The type of problems that data and integration presents cannot be solved by one person or one team. Maranca referenced the recent Facebook scandal, and how the US may now soon be forced to implement something similar to the UK’s current GDPR initiative; building on the ethics behind data storage and expanding on what should and shouldn’t be done with personal information. “Data people and HR practitioners need to be a team,” Maranca explained. “At the end of the day, if you want something sustainably implemented by employees, you have to win over their hearts and minds in order for them to fully back the process. HR’s got a prominent role in that.” Maranca’s also been talking about ethics in data for a while now, and the data industry isnfinally starting to sit up and take note. “I recorded a podcast two weeks before the Cambridge Analytic debacle broke, and it aired two days after the event, so it looked like it was “planted”. In reality, I’ve been saying for a while that the growth of the future will be fuelled by the trust that’s only achieved through the ethical treatment of data. The ethical approach is one which companies need to turn around their mindset to. “Perhaps what mostly upset people in regards to the Cambridge Analytica debacle was the continuous reference to not having done actually anything unlawful. In the eye of an ever more data savvy public that doesn’t make it right! Organizations will be always judged on whether they act lawfully, but at the same time staying within the boundaries of what is ethically right for third parties like employees, customers, investors will become an essential part of doing business. From an HR perspective, demonstrating ethical approach will go so far in helping with a company’s brand and overall talent attraction if the values of the company themselves would not have translated to their data too. “For Being an employer of choice, you’ll have to demonstrate a well-rounded commitment to your social responsibilities, volunteering, green initiatives, community support and, on top of that, ethical treatment of data,” summarized Maranca. “Otherwise prospective employees, especially in the youngest generations, will simply choose another brand.” Check out the unbelievably excellent line-up here.   Related stories: Great Place to Work®: The top 50 companies in Canada Ask a Lawyer: When can you dock an employee's pay?      DISCUSSION How can HR help with mergers and acquisitions?

Cambridge Analytica announces closure  The firm at the centre of the Facebook data scandal has announced it is shutting down following weeks of criticism.  Updated 3 May  Scandal-hit political analysis firm Cambridge Analytica is declaring bankruptcy and shutting down. The company, which worked on the Brexit and Donald Trump campaigns, sustained severe criticism after harvesting the data from millions of Facebook profiles. The move comes in the wake of rising legal costs in the Facebook investigation, and the loss of clients following revelations about the firm in March. In a statement, the company said it had been "vilified" for legal activities that are a "standard component" of advertising in the political world. Up to 87 million people had data harvested by an app which was then acquired by Cambridge Analytica (CA), according to Facebook. The app, a personality survey called This Is Your Digital Life, collected personal data from users and their Facebook friends, in line with the behaviour of many similar apps at the time. It allowed CA to tailor specific political adverts to small groups of people, already knowing what their likes and interests were, it is alleged. CA played a key role in mapping out the behaviour of voters in the run-up to the 2016 US election and was also used during the EU referendum campaign earlier that year. "Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas," CA said in a statement. "Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by Mr Malins' report [independent investigator Julian Malins], the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers. "As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration."

But one announcement hogged most of the public’s attention: Facebook will offer an online dating feature . The second that CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced this plan, Match Group ( MTCH ) stock fell off a cliff. Shares of the parent company of Match.com, OkCupid, and Tinder plummeted by about 20% before the day was out. It’s a reminder of just how much Wall Street investors believe in Facebook, and how little their faith has been damaged by the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. (Facebook stock bounced back after Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress, and is up 2.3% since the data scandal broke in March.) The thinking appears to be that if Facebook so much as waves its hand in the direction of an industry, everyone else in that industry better be scared. Remind you of any other company?

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announces a dating feature at Facebook’s F8 developers conference in San Jose, Calif., May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Stephen Lam The irony to this is that from a user perspective, you might think online dating is just the kind of service that people might be hesitant to trust Facebook with, amidst its PR nightmare over handling of users’ personal data. What if matches, and flirty messages, were to leak? There’s also an argument to be made that individual dating apps like Tinder and Bumble, which are hot and, for now, exist only for dating, have nothing to fear from Facebook because they have credibility right now and are unlikely to get ditched by people just because Facebook will now have a dating feature. And finally, Match Group is the king of the online dating space. It acquires almost every small competitor that gains steam. It owns a lot more than just Match, OkCupid, and Tinder, including HowAboutWe, PlentyOfFish, Meetic, and OurTime. It stands to reason that it has some experience in the space, while Facebook doesn’t, and that Facebook jumping in shouldn’t mean Match has anything to fear right away. Wall Street doesn’t feel that way. As Hilary Fordwich, founder of strategy firm Strelmark, told Fox Business on Tuesday , “The mass user doesn’t really know all the details, certainly not of Cambridge Analytica… I think this is the McDonald’s of dating and I think it’s going to go very well for Facebook.” Match Group shares on May 1, 2018 Despite the instant stock reaction in the form of a Match selloff, it’s worth remembering that Facebook has not always followed through on new apps or services it announces at its big glitzy launch events. In 2016, Facebook announced a new feature called Sports Stadium , “ but it does not share how many users are actually engaging with chat bots.) Zuckerberg did specify that Facebook’s dating app will only display first names, will not be connected to Messenger or WhatsApp, and will be visible only to other people using the app, not to your Facebook friends. — Daniel Roberts covers tech and media at Yahoo Finance.

"The Company is immediately ceasing all operations and the boards have applied to appoint insolvency practitioners Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP to act as the independent administrator for Cambridge Analytica," it said in a statement. In its statement, Cambridge Analytica said that it was a victim. "Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas," it said. The data firm was in serious trouble in several countries follow­ing dis­clo­sures about its use of Face­book data and the cam­paign tac­tics it employed to influence people for their clients. In March there was a video that showed company's chief executive Alexan­der Nix boasting of cam­paign tac­tics which included en­trapment Of po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents with bribes and sex. Following the expose the com­pany had sus­pended Nix, and to silence the outrage claimed that it had launched an in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tion to ascertain whether the com­pany en­gaged in any illegal work on po­lit­i­cal cam­paigns. Recently the Indian Information Technology Ministry had fired a second notice to the company to file details of what kind of data was mined by the company, through which means and subsidiaries in India and the mined data was used for what purposes. The ministry was terribly "miffed" with the data firm's reply to its first notice. Top officials had claimed that to a long list of queries the company had provided one line answers and the reply on the whole "smacked of arrogance". The company's decision to shut down operations may end up creating a dead-end for Indian authorities who want to know how wide were Cambridge Analytica and it's parent company SCL's operations in India and how the company was using this penetration CA was in deeper trouble in India when the govt received a conclusive evidence of the company's illegal activities from Facebook. The social networking site last month admitted that in 2014 an app on its platform siphoned data of 350 odd Indian users who downloaded it and over 5 lakh of their friend's on Facebook. This data was stolen by the app operator Alexander Kogan and was sold to Cambridge Analytica. Sources in Indian companies which have been associated with CA in the recent past say that the decision to shut down was taken as the one time very popular company was losing clients due to the recent bad name and the mounting legal troubles that not only involved angry companies like Facebook but governments of sovereign nations "The trouble of facing legal cases all over the world and the legal fee was assessed as a major hurdle against future existence. There was an attempt to rebrand the company's profile and business. But the board found that proposition replete with problems" said the head of a one-time partner companies of SCL in India. It was a bad day for Cambridge Analytica's employees as they found that the parent company SCL GEOUP was shutting down. Worse workers based In USA were directed by the management to "return their keycard" What is Cambridge Analytica scandal: Everything you need to know about Facebook data leak Past and current partners of SCL/CA we're keeping an eye on the developments in the UK based company. A senior manager in one of the firms said, "we are told that there was a conference call between various Cambridge Analytica offices in London, Washington DC, New York City and Virginia on Wednesday afternoon. In the conference Julian Wheatland, the current chairman of the SCL Group said that the investigations into Cambridge Analytica's data harvesting scandal, damaged reputation, and loss of clients were the reason for the decision." The shutdown of CA may block the chances of Indian authorities getting more answers, especially after the conclusion of the SCL internal report. The report says, "SCL makes no secret of its involvement in the 2010 Bihar Assembly Elections as can be seen from the following passage, on its website: CA was contracted to undertake an in-depth electorate analysis for the Bihar Assembly Election in 2010. The core challenge was to identify the floating/swing voters for each of the parties and to measure their levels electoral apathy, a result of the poor and unchanging condition of the state after 15 years of incumbent rule. In addition to the research phase, CA were tasked to organize the party base at the village level by creating a communication hierarchy to increase supporter motivation."

Saturday       Cambridge Analytica shuts operations after Facebook scandal    - A + A (May 3): Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining firm embroiled in a scandal over its work for U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, said it’s shutting down all operations effective immediately. The firm said Wednesday that it has begun insolvency proceedings in the U.K. and is also filing for bankruptcy in the U.S., according to a statement on Cambridge Analytica’s website. The company said it lost "virtually all" customers and suppliers after the New York Times, The Observer of London and other publications reported Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained information from tens of millions of Facebook Inc. users. The breach helped the company develop political ads and other techniques that underpinned its work on Trump’s campaign, according to the New York Times. It’s unclear what effect, if any, the ads, which were targeted to individual users’ "psychographics," had on actual voting, but the method that an academic working with Cambridge Analytica used to gather the Facebook data touched off a debate about how much information Facebook shares with third parties, and how it can be potentially used to manipulate views. Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing. "Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas," the company said in the statement. "It has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration." The company said that despite its "precarious financial condition," it plans to meet all its obligations to employees. Days after the initial stories emerged, Cambridge Analytica suspended Chief Executive Officer Alexander Nix as the bad news piled up. Nix was caught on camera, as part of a four-month undercover operation by Channel 4 News, boasting about the firm’s willingness to use bribes, entrapment with sex workers and other tactics to undermine political candidates. Nix had earlier told Bloomberg News that it was involved in as many as 10 campaigns for prime minister and president every year, including in Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. For one campaign in Latvia, according to documents given to prospective clients, the British affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, known as SCL Group, spread misinformation that was designed to stoke tensions between Latvians and ethnic Russians, blaming Russians for unemployment and helping a nationalist candidate to victory. The scandal has caused significant problems for Facebook as well, which estimates that as many as 87 million users may have been affected. The company spent weeks explaining, apologizing and adding more privacy features to the service and faced both a #deleteFacebook campaign and lengthy congressional hearings for Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. However, Facebook is so large and powerful that the outcry has so far had little impact on its business. The company last week reported quarterly revenue that topped analyst estimates. - Bloomberg     We deliver news to your inbox daily        Featured EVENING 5: India cops to grill AirAsia boss  Featured FRIDAY TAKEAWAY:What next for Gamuda and IJM?

"It has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business," the company, accused of misusing tens of millions of Facebook users' data, said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica (CA), hired by Donald Trump's presidential campaign, said it had been "vilified" in recent months over "numerous unfounded accusations", which had decimated its business. It has vehemently denied exploiting Facebook users' data for the election campaign of US President Donald Trump following revelations it gathered up profile information via a personality prediction app. Facebook has admitted that up to 87 million users may have had their data hijacked by the firm. CA claims it deleted data about Facebook users obtained in breach of the social network's terms of service. The company said it hired British barrister Julian Malins to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations, whose report it posted on its website Wednesday. "(The) report...concluded that the allegations were not 'borne out by the facts'", CA said. "Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers." Its board has appointed lawyers in Britain to oversee the insolvency process, and would be following suit in America, CA added. "While this decision was extremely painful for Cambridge Analytica's leaders, they recognize that it is all the more difficult for the Company’s dedicated employees who learned today that they likely would be losing their jobs as a result of the damage caused to the business by the unfairly negative media coverage," it said in the statement. Noting its financial condition was precarious, it added: "Cambridge Analytica intends to fully meet its obligations to its employees, including with respect to notice periods, severance terms, and redundancy entitlements." react-empty: 2 What to read next AFP News AFP News Associated Press Associated Press AFP News Yahoo News Singapore Associated Press WOWtv react-empty: 118 Yahoo News Singapore Associated Press WOWtv AFP News Yahoo News Singapore The Guardian Associated Press WOWtv Associated Press AFP News Digital Spy Associated Press WOWtv Malay Mail South China Morning Post Reuters Malay Mail WOWtv Malay Mail EdgeProp react-empty: 62 react-empty: 65 react-empty: 66 bf1-sdarlaws-002.adx.bf1.yahoo.com Sat Jun 2 03:23:54 UTC 2018

Nigel Oakes, the founder of SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica’s British affiliate, confirmed that both companies were closing down, reported The Wall Street Journal. Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quickadsense.com/ JKR Ad In March this year, the company had announced that it was suspending its CEO Alexander Nix and added that it had launched an independent investigation to ascertain the allegations of wrongdoing by its leadership team. The WSJ report also added that the CA decided to close its doors because it was losing clients and facing mounting legal fees in the Facebook investigation. The firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers. The CA scandal had adversely impacted the political discourse even in India with both BJP and Congress trading charges of having sought the help of the tainted company. The Facebook had later banned the company from its platform. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to depose before a US Congressional committee last month to answer questions on allegations of data breach from his platform. Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had warned  Zuckergerg, of consequences if he did not come clean on the allegations of data theft from his social media platform. Prasad also went on to accuse the Congress of having hired Cambridge Analytica to help the party in Gujarat elections.   END THEIA POST SLIDER Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quickadsense.com/ Responsive JKR Responsive JKR Responsive JKR  Cambridge Analytica Facebook Twitter tweet Fresh criticism for CJI Dipak Misra as Supreme Court Collegium defers decision on Justice KM Joseph BJP सांसद शत्रुघन सिन्हा बोले- ‘लालू यादव के साथ एम्स में रहने के दौरान किया गया अमानवीय व्यवहार’ /.post RELATED ARTICLES MORE FROM AUTHOR India ABC drops show of Trump-supporter comedian Roseanne Barr for racist tweet, In India racists are rewarded with job in Lok Sabha TV ./td-related-span4 Goa UK elderly couple forced to return from Goa Airport because they were late by five minutes ./td-related-span4 World Malian immigrant wins million hearts in Paris by saving child’s life, becomes French President’s special guest ./td-related-span4 ./row-fluid World Donald Trump stopped from blocking people on Twitter, US court rules ./td-related-span4 World UN to launch war crimes probe into massacre of Palestinians by Israeli forces ./td-related-span4 Politics Israeli troops kill 55 Palestinians including children, injure 2,700 ./td-related-span4 ./row-fluid Media Virus ‘Deportation’ of Muneeza Hashmi, daughter of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, to Pakistan triggers angry reactions ./td-related-span4 Sports Hockey legend Mansoor Ahmed, whose desperate plea for Indian visa evoked hateful messages, finally dies ./td-related-span4 India Sushma Swaraj hailed as Delhi social worker’s campaign results in repatriation of Bangladeshi man after 10 years in Tihar jail ./td-related-span4 ./row-fluid ./block LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

What’s interesting is the fact that this dating service has taken almost a decade to materialize and could be a cause of worry for some of the established ones in the same space. Facebook is leveraging the 200 million users of its main site who have described themselves as single. However, the main concern for the team at Facebook and the users all over would be the kind of security and privacy the service will be able to build within it, particularly coming so soon after the huge Cambridge Analytica episode that pushed the company on its backfoot. There are still a number of users out there who are not sure if they can trust Facebook with their data. This and the way Facebook is able to build on the dating service with all its features will only decide how much of a disruption it is able to cause for leading dating sites like Tinder, OkCupid, JD Date and Christian Mingle and others. To start with, it has been kept simple with a heart-shaped icon on the Facebook page and clicking on it will take the user to the dating site. You will have to create your profile if you are interested in looking for a date through the Facebook interface. The preferences indicated in your profile will be used by Facebook to suggest matching people for you to pursue. There would be a ‘pass’ button to move on to the next contact if you are not interested and the ‘interested’ button will take you to the matching person’s page. No specific date has been mentioned so far by Facebook for the launch of the dating service. Zuckerberg is reported to have indicated that he hoped the users will go for long-term relationships through the service as opposed to mere “hook-ups”. He also shared with the developers at F8 that it was about 2 years ago that the idea of starting a dating service was driven home when couples who had met each other on Facebook and went on to develop a relationship were posted on the site and thousands had responded to the photo of ne such couple he had posted on his page. The privacy issue is on top of their mind and to begin with the exchange of communication will be only through texts. They are conscious of issues faced by other dating sites when nude photographs suddenly crop up. Mark Zuckerberg also informed the developers that the “clear history” option to be provided to Facebook users will appear soon. It is being worked on. The announcement of the dating service yielded positive increase for the shares of Facebook in the bourses, while some of the serious competitors found their shares sliding.     /.block

And how safe is your data?    ads_sharebox_260x60 With 19-million of us using Facebook regularly, the platform is South Africa's most powerful media outstripping the old print giants, all online products and very soon taking on television. Yet, trying to find out how safe South Africans are from the manipulation of data that is besetting the blue platform, which has revolutionised the meaning of "like" and "share" and opened up unimagined vistas of communications and commerce, is an almost impossible task. entry_paragraph_1_ad Facebook is having a tough year after revelations that the political research and analysis company, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly accessed the data of tens of millions of Facebook members. In South Africa, those impacted number about 96,000 people after 13 people downloaded the "YourDigitalLife" app which then collected the data of networks of friends of those people. Yet, Facebook will not provide details of the accounts, or even their geographies, to assess the damage. Granted, Cambridge Analytica used the information to try to swing elections primarily in the U.S., but the story is a cautionary tale of how Facebook can be used to mess with your mind and to upend democratic processes. entry_paragraph_2_ad How safe is your Facebook page from disinformation and manipulation? You will never know because the platform has thrown a dragnet around sharing information about how it is used in South Africa and the rest of the continent. entry_paragraph_3_ad TEMPLATE CODE TEMPLATE CODE ENDS The company will reveal details about developer circles it sponsors and it will share information about how small and medium-sized businesses are using its Pages service to grow, but it will not reveal to what extent Facebook is a source of news to South Africans or to what extent it is becoming a source of political campaigning by party-political forces. This can be gauged by how much political advertising the site is carrying, but Facebook is a black hole when it comes to revealing who is advertising and what they are trying to "sell" us. A company spokesperson said: "It would be inappropriate for us to comment or share information about advertising spends." The company has a public policy team, which oversees how Facebook is used in elections. But how it vets information on the platform to ensure that it does not corrupt into disinformation is an opaque process at best. entry_paragraph_4_ad The Silicon Valley giant recently opened up its standards processes to public scrutiny when it made public how it goes about assessing controversial material but it will not specifically answer questions about its processes in South Africa or the rest of Africa. Facebook is huge across the continent. In Nigeria, there are 24-million total monthly active users and in Kenya there are 8.5-million people firing up the world's foremost sharing platform. All Facebook will say is this: "Africa is important to Facebook. With more than a billion people there is strong business momentum and opportunity in many countries across the continent." The company, which reported stellar results last week despite the data scandal, sees Africa as an emerging market of great potential because economies are growing and because business usage is high. In addition, the population curve on the continent may help it buck the trend of Facebook's user cohort getting older and older. A Facebook spokesperson told HuffPost SA: "The future of Africa is young (Africa has more people aged under 20 than anywhere else in the world). One of our key roles across the continent is supporting and investing in young and diverse creative talent". READ: CEO Mark Zuckerberg Says Facebook Will Rank News Outlets By Trustworthiness It hosts 27 developer circles with 27,000 members in cities like Johannesburg, Accra, Lagos, Kinshasa and Nairobi. The tech startups coming out of these circles are often exciting and innovative. But the story of the data breach by Cambridge Analytica raises a caution that all of us who fire up the blue platform need to be aware of: the products being developed get access to our data. That is the "sell" or what attracts the developers to Facebook and this provides the platform with the content it needs to keep us coming back for more for more minutes per day. The high numbers of users, in turn, create massive political markets that dark forces are conniving to manipulate. Facebook's only just beginning to grasp the nettle as the hearings in Congress attended by CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed. Last week Zuckerberg again sought to dampen down worries among users about the safety of our data. But, here, at the southern tip of Africa, it's still the old opaque Facebook culture that determines what you may and may not know about how your data is being used and how the algorithm chooses what you see and do not see. start relEntries Related Coverage  Facebook Reveals Strong Profits Despite Cambridge Analytica Scandal   Explained: What Facebook Will and Won't Let You Post   5 Ways To Avoid Becoming Facebook's Next Data Victim  end relEntries ads_article_bottom Suggest a correction   Facebook Marc Zuckerberg News  Desktop and Mapi Conversations Mobile Conversations ads_below_entry_recirc ads_article_foot ads_right_rail_upper ads_right_rail_flex TEMPLATE CODE TEMPLATE CODE ENDS ads_upper_sponsorship ads_right_rail_middle SUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

But does it amount to censorship?      Getty Images/iStockphoto   ads_sharebox_260x60 "We are contemplating to regulate the space. Even the best democracies that are revered, they regulate the space," said former minister of state security David Mahlobo last year, in response to a question by a reporter about fake news. The space he was referring to was social media. entry_paragraph_1_ad He was never ready for the response, as evidenced by the hashtag #handsoffsocialmedia that trended thereafter, prompting petitions against the move by advocacy group Right2Know (R2K). Only dictators & despots try & silence their public.

Let's first 'regulate' the #HireAGraduate movement. — Phumla wakaGcwabaza (@gcwabaza_phumla) March 6, 2017 My ancestors did not die for my freedom just for you to try and censor me. #HandsOffSocialMedia — Omphile (@SecondHandReign) March 6, 2017 entry_paragraph_3_ad TEMPLATE CODE TEMPLATE CODE ENDS "This is a clear move by state securocrats to try clamp down on freedom of expression and increase their powers to censor the internet," said R2K in a statement . The organisation believes that any form of internet regulation would "hand the keys of the internet" to government. entry_paragraph_4_ad Is internet regulation possible in South Africa? "Broadly speaking [internet regulation is] impractical, but for very specific reasons it can work," World Wide Worx MD Arthur Goldstuck told HuffPost. He made an example of Facebook, which may soon find itself tied to some form of internet regulation when the E.U. implements the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was adopted in 2016 and will be enacted in May 2018. The regulation will deal with data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union, further addressing the export of personal data outside the E.U. As is, when one uses a platform like Facebook, one willingly discloses personal data. Facebook then has the right to process this data to provide their services when one asks them to. However, the application of the GDPR will prevent Facebook from using any E.U. citizen's personal data for any further purpose, unless the user permits this. "This means that although Facebook is sitting on top of a trove of personal data, it will have to start offering a form of ad targeting that does not process these data points, unless it can get explicit consent," explained Johnny Ryan of ad tech firm PageFair. "In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica issue, it is unlikely that people will volunteer this consent," Ryan added. Facebook has said it will comply with this new regulation. "So it's possible to make similar rules in South Africa which Facebook (or any other social media platform) would have to abide by, if they want to carry on operating in the country," said Goldstuck. 'Some form of regulation may be necessary in South Africa' – media scholar Media scholar and Wits University lecturer, Nkululeko Sibiya believes some form of regulation – like the E.U. is implementing with the GDPR, especially in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal – may be necessary in South Africa, to protect the data and privacy of South Africans active on social media platforms like Facebook. "It is clear that we now need regulation more than ever, since the democratic citizen is under attack, not only from governments and political parties, but from companies that make money from surveillance capitalism," he told HuffPost. He also highlighted concerns with the lack of monitoring of sensitive and even dangerous content that makes the rounds on South African social media platforms. "I do not think we need to regulate all videos uploaded by individuals – however, we do need monitoring of violent and terrorist material." A similar view is held by the Freedom of Expression Institute [FXI]. "Cybercrime internationally is on the increase, and people are falling victim to hacking, cyberforgery, cyberextortion and the unlawful interception of data. In order to curb the above, laws need to be put in place to regulate the cyberspace," said the organisation's Nobuntu Mbelle. Laws could be created for regulation that would ensure that conventional law is also applicable online to social media platforms. "For example, abusive content like harassment, threats and defamation are illegal in conventional law so, technically, they should be illegal on social media. The challenge would be how to apply these laws online," added Goldstuck. Any form of intervention, however, would need to be minimal, "in order to not hamper the rights afforded and guaranteed to all in the Constitution", Mbelle told HuffPost. When regulation becomes censorship "Regulating what individuals are doing, however, is totally different, because that amounts to censorship – even if it may not be posited that way by government," said Goldstuck. He remarked that, since democracy, South Africa has been remarkable in protecting and advancing freedom of expression, "so to try [to] regulate social content on social media would be going backwards". Sibiya, whose master's research focused on threats to media freedom – referring in particular to the state of the nation address (Sona) in 2015 and the signal-jamming scandal – said freedom of speech and the free flow of information are central to democratic and economic development. "In 2015 there were a lot of sentiments expressed in the public sphere via the internet. The government of the day responded by disrupting the internet signal. Evidence from my work shows that social media platforms, especially Twitter, was used by journalists in the press gallery to inform one another about what was going on, discuss plans of action, and most importantly to address parliamentary officials and ministers. "The citizens were able realise the constitutional rights of freedom of expression and see what their representatives were doing. They engaged in debates about the issue online. They shared censored footage which included pictures and videos," Sibiya told HuffPost. And it is this very right that censorship masquerading as regulation would affect.

It is a vital tool for communication, citizens must be allowed to express their opinions on the government of the day freely without persecution or interruption #InternetFreedom pic.twitter.com/N8pGgI2xg2 — UAPDC (@uapdc) April 9, 2018 #Handsoffsocialmedia what makes the internet great is the freedom and equality — Nicki123 (@nicki1forthewin) July 27, 2017 Is self-regulation not enough? A counterargument that's been put forward, however, is that regulation of social media already exists. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have added self-regulation measures to empower users to take action against online harassment and cut down on the spread of fake news and propaganda. "These systems are flawed, and users need to be empowered to engage with content critically and decide for themselves whether to trust the content they access," said R2K. "Strengthening self-regulation mechanisms is a viable option, as state intervention may result in the loss of social media freedom and independence. Because self-regulation has not been as effective as the public would like, a compromise could be reached between the two extremes – in the form of minimal statutory interference and maintaining elements of self-regulation. There would be a greater sense of accountability, and the independence of social media and fundamental rights would be maintained and protected," Mbelle said. Further, there is already a range of internet regulatory policies in the pipeline that the R2K feels are "deeply problematic censorship policies, including the Film and Publication Board's internet censorship regulations, the draft hate speech bill, and the new cybercrimes bill." "State interference and the passing of regulatory bills such as the Cybercrime and Cyber Security Bill could, if abused, adversely affect internet freedom in the country – but the fear of regulation should not be put before the fundamental right to privacy which our Constitution protects," added Mbelle. What regulation should probably look like, if we ever get there In a democracy, this regulation would protect the vulnerable from criminal activity and the ill intentions of big corporations online, while facilitating open communication and protecting freedom of speech and expression. "What is key is that regulation must reflect the desires and aspirations of all groups in society, but still provide the necessary security that states demand as well as the access to audiences that companies seek," said Sibiya. A mammoth task to achieve, he admitted, as it would suggest not only getting together key players including nonprofit organisations, tech experts and digital activists, but also getting them to agree on regulation that would moderately satisfy all parties involved, but chiefly protect the data and privacy of all South African citizens. "In the main, regulation would need to look at code and how it is designed; it would need to look at companies and how they regulate their own activities. So you might need a new organ of state that is independent, like a Chapter 9 institution, staffed by various experts from different sectors of society to oversee the implementation of regulations." A view the FXI concurs with, as previously put forward by the organisation in its Internet Freedom in Africa Baseline Report : "Civil society organisations should proactively engage service providers and governments to ensure that their policies and regulations do not violate the rights of people to express themselves and access information offline and online." ads_article_bottom Suggest a correction   arts and tech Facebook Instagram internet regulation News social media Twitter  Desktop and Mapi Conversations Mobile Conversations ads_below_entry_recirc ads_article_foot ads_right_rail_upper ads_right_rail_flex TEMPLATE CODE TEMPLATE CODE ENDS ads_upper_sponsorship ads_right_rail_middle SUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

[w53] WhatsApp co-founder to quit after encryption row | ITWeb BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY MEDIA COMPANY share business keyboard_arrow_down bookmark keyboard_arrow_down Search search  home Home / Career Moves / WhatsApp co-founder to quit after encryption row WhatsApp co-founder to quit after encryption row  2min 20sec  WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum. he co-founder of WhatsApp, a messaging service owned by Facebook with more than a billion daily users, said on Monday he was leaving the company, in a loss of one of the strongest advocates for privacy inside Facebook. Jan Koum's plan to exit comes after clashing with the parent company over WhatApp's strategy and Facebook's attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption, the Washington Post earlier reported, citing people familiar with the internal discussions. "It's been almost a decade since Brian and I started WhatsApp, and it's been an amazing journey with some of the best people," Koum, WhatsApp's chief executive, said in a post on his Facebook page referring to co-founder Brian Acton. "But it is time for me to move on." He did not give a date for his departure and could not immediately be reached for comment. Acton left the messaging service company in September to start a foundation, after spending eight years with WhatsApp. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg commented on Koum's post, saying he was grateful for what Koum taught him about encryption "and its ability to take power from centralised systems and put it back in people's hands. Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp." Facebook has battled European regulators over a plan to use WhatsApp user data, including phone numbers, to develop products and target ads. The plan is suspended, but WhatsApp said last week it still wanted to move forward eventually. Stanford alumnus Acton and Ukrainian immigrant Koum co-founded WhatsApp in 2009. Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion in cash and stock. WhatsApp, a pun on the phrase "What's up?," grew in popularity in part because its encrypted messages are stored on users' smartphones and not on company servers, making the service more private. Concerns about Facebook's handling of personal information have grown since the social network's admission in March that the data of millions of users was wrongly harvested by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has taken steps to generate revenue from WhatsApp, which unlike Facebook does not have advertising. WhatsApp's management has fiercely opposed advertising, saying in 2012 they did not want to be "just another ad clearinghouse" where the engineering team "spends their day tuning data mining". Instead, WhatsApp charged a $1 annual subscription. It dropped that in 2016, moving toward a plan to charge businesses for specialised accounts.
