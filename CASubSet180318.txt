Source: US ABC A British lawmaker accused Facebook today of misleading officials by downplaying the risk of users' data being shared without their consent. Conservative legislator Damian Collins, who heads the British Parliament's media committee, said he would ask Zuckerberg or another Facebook executive to appear before his panel, which is investigating disinformation and "fake news." Collins said Facebook has "consistently understated" the risk of data leaks and gave misleading answers to the committee. "Someone has to take responsibility for this," he said. "It's time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page." Collins also accused the head of the UK-based data firm Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, of lying. Nix told the committee last month that his firm had not received data from a researcher accused of obtaining millions of Facebook users' personal information. In Washington, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said on Twitter that Zuckerberg "needs to testify before Senate Judiciary." "This is a major breach that must be investigated," Klobuchar, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said. "It's clear these platforms can't police themselves." Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed Klobuchar's complaint. "This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West," he said. "It's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency." Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said on Twitter that "Massachusetts residents deserve answers" and announced that her office will investigate. The officials reacted to reports in The New York Times and The Guardian of London that Cambridge Analytica, which is best known for working on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, had improperly obtained Facebook user data and retained it after claiming it had deleted the information.   Related Internet eo relatedContent  no more content back to top loading error refresh standard advert LATEST POPULAR FEATURED news latest story stream Following component is included by DynamicIncludeFilter (path: /content/tvnz/onenews/popularStories/news.esi./news/components/popularStories ) Following component is included by DynamicIncludeFilter (path: /content/tvnz/onenews/story/2018/06/02/watch-it-was-like-saving-private-ryan-ex-south-african-cop-co/_jcr_content/asStoryStreamItem.storyStreamSection-popular.storyStreamItemRank-1.esi./news/components/storyStreamItem )  00:51 1 					Watch: 'It was like Saving Private Ryan' - South African ex-cop confirms poisoning of All Blacks before 1995 World Cup final Following component is included by DynamicIncludeFilter (path: /content/tvnz/onenews/story/2018/06/01/toni-street/_jcr_content/asStoryStreamItem.storyStreamSection-popular.storyStreamItemRank-2.esi./news/components/storyStreamItem )  00:58 2 					'A little bit sad' - Toni Street responds on air to backlash over the six month’s maternity leave she’s likely to take Following component is included by DynamicIncludeFilter (path: /content/tvnz/onenews/story/2018/06/01/shipping-containers/_jcr_content/asStoryStreamItem.storyStreamSection-popular.storyStreamItemRank-3.esi./news/components/storyStreamItem ) 3 					Ship loses 80 containers off NSW coast in wild weather Following component is included by DynamicIncludeFilter (path: /content/tvnz/onenews/story/2018/06/02/kosmo/_jcr_content/asStoryStreamItem.storyStreamSection-popular.storyStreamItemRank-4.esi./news/components/storyStreamItem )  00:59 4 					'I knew something sinister had happened' - Kosmo the police dog's handler describes the night he thought he would lose his partner Following component is included by DynamicIncludeFilter (path: /content/tvnz/onenews/story/2018/06/02/watch-sharks-prop-has-absolute-shocker-runs-to-wrong-end-after/_jcr_content/asStoryStreamItem.storyStreamSection-popular.storyStreamItemRank-5.esi./news/components/storyStreamItem )  00:15 5 					Watch: New Zealander has absolute shocker for Sharks, runs to wrong end of the field during NRL game Following component is included by DynamicIncludeFilter (path: /content/tvnz/onenews/story/2018/05/30/daniel/_jcr_content/asStoryStreamItem.storyStreamSection-featured.esi./news/components/storyStreamItem )  01:47  					'Flat-tyre, Fat-tower, Fa'afoi' - Breakfast's Daniel Faitaua recalls shocking attempts at pronouncing his name, as Super Rugby stars encourage Kiwis to say theirs correctly Daniel has also been mistaken for former TVNZ weather presenter turned politician Tamati Coffey.

Logout India Insider Tech Careers Finance Strategy Life Politics › › Christopher Wylie, the 28-year-old whistleblower of the Trump-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica, says his Facebook account has been disabled Dave Smith Facebook Linkedin WhatsApp Twitter Google+ Reddit Christopher Wylie is the 28-year-old whistleblower on Cambridge Analytica, the data-analytics firm that played an important role in Trump's 2016 campaign and the Brexit Leave campaign. Wylie said his Facebook account was disabled on Sunday, "for blowing the whistle, on something they have known privately for two years." Facebook says it is suspending Wylie's Facebook account, despite his role as a whistleblower, as it carries out its investigation on Cambridge Analytica.   Christopher Wylie, the 28-year-old man who both founded and blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica, the data-analytics firm that played an important role in Trump's 2016 campaign and the Brexit Leave campaign, had his Facebook account disabled on Sunday. Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform on Friday, amid multiple revealing stories published in The New York Times and The Guardian over the weekend that included interviews with Wylie, who oversaw the conception and realization of Cambridge Analytica's tool that harvested millions of Facebook profiles illegitimately, to be used for various political campaigns in both the US and UK In an interview published in The Guardian on Sunday, Wylie detailed how Cambridge Analytica harvested data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles between June and August 2014, even sharing a 2016 letter from Facebook's own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica "had acquired the data illegitimately," and asking Wylie to delete the data. Perhaps most troubling is that, according to Wylie, Facebook never followed up in the two years since that letter to see if he had, in fact, deleted the stolen data. (He didn't). Despite reportedly having evidence that Cambridge Analytica had illegitimately collected user data, Facebook did not suspend Cambridge Analytica until Friday - more than two years after the alleged data breach from Cambridge Analytica was first reported, and four days after The Guardian reportedly sought comment from Facebook about the story. (Facebook, for its part, doesn't call this a breach. A spokesperson told The Guardian:  So, why did Facebook suspend Wylie's account? Business Insider reached out for comment, and Facebook was not immediately available to respond. Facebook did say on Friday, however, that it would suspend Wylie's account while it carried out its investigation. It's unclear if his account would be restored after the investigation ends. The full stories about Wylie, Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and the roles they played in the 2016 presidential election are truly incredible and worth reading - The New York Times story , as well as The Guardian's interview with Wylie and its story on the harvested Facebook profiles .

Alexander Nix, chief executive officer of London-based Cambridge Analytica, told a House of Commons committee that his company didn’t receive data from Global Science Research Co. That contradicts newspaper reports that it did receive the information and used it to reach U.S. voters with hyper-targeted messaging. Damian Collins, chair of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he will ask Nix to explain his comments and answer further questions about the company’s connections to the Facebook data. He also plans to ask Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to have a senior executive of the social networking giant answer the panel’s questions. “We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Collins said in a statement. “Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee.” Cambridge Analytica and parent Strategic Communication Laboratories have been suspended from Facebook, "pending further information," the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a blog post Friday. Cambridge Analytica said in a Saturday statement it did nothing illegal and is ​in touch with Facebook in order to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. The data firm was hired to help with voter outreach by the Trump campaign, whose former campaign manager, Steve Bannon, had been on the company’s board. According to the New York Times, it harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without permission, which allowed it to exploit the private social-media activity of these users in support of the Trump campaign. In a story Sunday, Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old former Cambridge Analytica employee, told the Guardian he helped orchestrate the operation. He said Cambridge Analytica hired the Global Science Research to help it mine and process “Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.” Nix told Collins on Feb. 27 none of Cambridge Analytica’s data came from GSR and they once had a contract with the company that proved “fruitless.”   ©2018 Bloomberg L.P.

The company said in a statement that it was trying to determine the accuracy of allegations that a researcher gave the firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately obtained Facebook user data starting in 2014.   In the statement from Paul Grewal, a Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel, the company said it was committed to "vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information."

These are external links and will open in a new window   Facebook and a US data firm, Cambridge Analytica, have been accused of "misleading" Parliament. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said both firms must answer more questions over claims that details from 50 million profiles were gathered without consent. Facebook suspended the US company, saying it breached its policies. Cambridge Analytica said it does not hold or use any Facebook data. Both companies deny any wrongdoing. The data firm is primarily known for its role in US President Trump's election campaign, where it provided details on American voters. Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital Culture Committee, said comments by Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix at a Commons hearing last month must be explained. Did Cambridge Analytica play a role in the EU referendum? Mr Collins said reports by the Guardian and the Observer made it "clear that he [Mr Nix] has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements". Cambridge Analytica has denied allegations that Mr Nix misled that committee. Facebook claims Cambridge Analytica, among others, did not destroy all the data it obtained, which breached its policies. 'Avoided questions' The claims against the company rose to prominence after a former employee told the Guardian about his time at Cambridge Analytica. Mr Collins also criticised Facebook, saying his committee had "repeatedly" asked the firm about how companies accessed user data from the website and if information had been taken without users' consent. He claims that the firm "deliberately avoided answering straight questions" from the committee by sending witnesses who claimed not to know the answers. "This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed." He also claimed Facebook had failed to supply evidence of the relationship between the social media platform and Cambridge Analytica. "The reputation of this company is being damaged by stealth, because of their constant failure to respond with clarity and authority to the questions of genuine public interest that are being directed to them. "Someone has to take responsibility for this." A spokesperson for Facebook said that the data collection was not a hack or a breach. "People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked," the company said.

While providing a way to keep in touch with friends, services such as Facebook and Twitter also offer an unprecedented amount of information to advertisers. To harvest data on American voters, Aleksandr Kogan — an academic working for the research firm Cambridge Analytica — paid Facebook users small sums to take a personality quiz via an “app” on the website. Facebook allows companies to develop apps which sit on top of the social network and can be accessed and shared by its users. Some of the most widely shared are puzzle games and quizzes.

In Britain, the head of the parliamentary committee investigating fake news accused Cambridge Analytica and Facebook of misleading MPs after revelations in the Observer that more than 50m Facebook profiles were harvested and used to build a system that may have influenced voters in the 2016 presidential campaign. The Conservative MP Damian Collins said he would call the heads of both companies, Alexander Nix and Mark Zuckerberg, to give further testimony. His intervention came after a whistleblower spoke to the Observer and described how the profiles, mostly of US voters, were harvested for Cambridge Analytica, in one of Facebook’s biggest ever data breaches. The disclosures caused outrage on both sides of the Atlantic; in the US, a state attorney general has called for investigations and greater accountability and regulation. There have been reports that Cambridge Analytica is trying to stop the broadcast of a Channel 4 News exposé in which Nix is said to talk unguardedly about the company’s practices. According to the Financial Times, reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly filmed a series of meetings, including one with the chief executive. The report is due to air this week. Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be recalling Nix to give further testimony to explain why he had told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook . “We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments,” he said. Collins will also call on Zuckerberg to testify. He said the company appeared to have previously sent executives who were able to avoid difficult questions and who “claimed not to know the answers”. The two men may also face a summons from US lawmakers. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Cambridge Analytica to be “thoroughly investigated” and said Facebook must answer questions about how it came to provide private user information to an academic with links to Russia. The Republican majority on the House intelligence committee announced this week they were winding up their investigation into Russia’s election interference, concluding there was no collusion with Trump’s campaign and, even more controversially, that Moscow did not seek to assist him. Schiff fiercely condemned that decision and said the Democratic minority would continue working on prescriptions for protecting the country in the future. “This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump’s political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,” he told the Guardian. “The company has repeatedly touted its ability to influence voters through ‘psychographic’ targeting and has claimed it was the fundamental reason that Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Indeed, it may be that through Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign made use of illegitimately acquired data on millions of Americans in order to help sway the election.” Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2m, according to Federal Election Commission records. It denies using any Facebook data in the campaign. Shortly before the story broke, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer that it was making “false and defamatory” allegations and reserved Facebook’s legal position. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by Cambridge Analytica, working with Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research (GSR), was a data breach. It also suspended the whistleblower Chris Wylie from the platform “pending further information” over misuse of data, along with his former employer Cambridge Analytica and its affiliates, and the academic they worked with, Kogan. The public attack on Wylie came after he had approached the tech company about the data breach, offering to help investigate. He described it as a chilling attack on someone acting in the public interest. explainer “They acknowledged my offer but then turned around and shot the messenger. I’m trying to make amends for my mistakes and so should Facebook,” he told the Guardian. “Facebook has known about this for at least two years and did almost nothing to fix it. This is not new. And it’s only by coming forward that Facebook is now taking action. People need to know this kind of profiling is happening.” Collins said his committee wanted more information from Facebook about the circumstances around the breach. “Data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.” “We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,” Collins said. “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.” Last month, both Facebook representatives and Nix told the parliamentary inquiry into fake news that the company did not have or use private Facebook data, or any data from GSR.

Collins attacked Facebook for appearing to have been “deliberately avoiding answering straight questions” in testimony to the committee. “It is now clear that data has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns,” Collins said. “Facebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it.” Cambridge Analytica responded to the Observer story on Twitter before Collins had said Nix would be recalled. “We refute(s) these mischaracterizations and false allegations,” it said. “Reality Check: Cambridge Analytica uses client and commercially and publicly available data; we don’t use or hold any Facebook data,” the company said. “When we learned GSR sold us Facebook data that it shouldn’t have done, we deleted it all – system wide audit to verify.” The Observer The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791.

[w458] The Opening Argument in the Trial of Donald J. Trump Follow Cheat Sheet Politics Entertainment World News Half Full Arts and Culture U.S. News Tech Hunt for the Cure Science Scouted Travel Annotation Homepage opinion Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast opinion Quid Pro Quo The Opening Argument in the Trial of Donald J. Trump For Trump, the motive for the crime was to use any edge he could to win the election, even if it was clearly illegal, and to complete business deals with the Russians if he lost. Jonathan Alter Nick Akerman 03.18.18 9:02 PM ET opinion Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast Good prosecutors always have a theory of the case. While much of special counsel Robert Mueller’s evidence remains unknown, the contours of the criminal conspiracy case against President Trump are coming into view. The public might hear it at an impeachment trial in the Senate next year (if the House goes Democratic) or in a jury trial (if the Supreme Court, which has never ruled on the constitutionality of criminally prosecuting a president, allows it). Either way, here is a reasonable approximation of the story the prosecutor would tell the court and the American people in his opening argument: May it please the court. Ladies and gentlemen: This is a simple case about a plot hatched during the 2016 presidential election. The story begins with close business contacts between the Defendant, Donald John Trump, and Russian oligarchs, including some who obtained and distributed illegally hacked emails belonging to the Democratic Party in order to help Trump win . It continues with Trump and his associates—after receiving stolen goods—promising a major favor to the Russians in return for their criminal activity. And it ends with the Defendant Trump trying to cover up his crimes. Actually, the true end of the story is in your hands—when justice and accountability are restored. First, a little Latin. I took Latin in high school but remember almost nothing. I have, however, picked up a few Latin phrases over the years. One of them, which will be an important part of this case, is quid pro quo. It literally means, in English, “something for something.” An exchange of favors. You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours. Now, all of us engage in favor swapping or quid pro quos every day. Nothing wrong with it most of the time. If you cook dinner, I’ll do the dishes. But when the “quid” is an illegal act, it’s a whole different story. Then the “quo” is often illegal, too, even if it wouldn’t be on its own. If you rob a bank and use the money you stole to help me, and in return I promise to help you out, then I’m in a lot of trouble, too, especially if I try to throw the cops off the scent. In this case, you will learn that in return for the Russians stealing and releasing emails, the Defendant Trump and members of his staff promised—publicly and privately—that after being sworn in, the new president would drop U.S. government sanctions against the Russian government and Russian oligarchs who are close to Russian President Vladimir Putin . The stolen emails and a variety of other illegal Russian efforts to hurt the Clinton campaign were the currency the Russians used to barter for sanctions relief. That quid pro quo is the criminal conspiracy at the heart of this case. As you will learn, a criminal conspiracy means that the people involved had a mutual agreement, spoken or unspoken, to commit acts that were illegal. They didn’t have to sit in some dark room plotting or tell each other to commit crimes. An informal understanding to break the law constitutes a conspiracy. What was the motive for the crime? For Trump, it was to use any edge he could to win the election, even if it was clearly illegal, and to stay on good enough terms with Russian oligarchs to allow himself and his family and associates loan relief and other business deals with them if he lost. For the Russians, the motive was to harm Hillary Clinton, who as secretary of state under President Obama had been critical of their behavior and pushed successfully for sanctions against the Russian government and oligarchs. They saw a chance to both win sanctions relief and fulfill a longstanding plan to disrupt American elections. You will hear testimony that Trump and his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, a longtime pro-Russian lobbyist, had extensive financial ties to Russians through the Bank of Cyprus and other banks and a series of real estate investments and golf club developments that offered Russian oligarchs a way to launder their dirty money. Russians lent tens of millions of dollars to both Trump and Manafort, leaving both indebted to criminals who hoped to collect at least partly through new American policies toward oligarchs. You will learn a lot in this case about how these Russian criminals operated. For decades, Russian intelligence has specialized in what is called kompromat —obtaining compromising information to be used for blackmail or extortion. The information gathered on Trump going back to his visits to the Soviet Union in the 1980s gave the Russians leverage over him in his business activities that extended into his campaign and presidency. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, Trump—by then a declared presidential candidate—continued his efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow even after sanctions were imposed on Russia following the annexation of Crimea and military aggression against Ukraine. You will learn that the Trump Organization’s relations with a bank sanctioned by the United States broke the law. The core of the criminal conspiracy began in March of 2016 when Russian hackers, backed by high-ranking officials in the Russian government, infiltrated the computers of the Democratic National Committee. Within a few weeks, in April of 2016, the Russians informed the Trump campaign through one of Trump’s foreign policy advisors, George Papadopoulos , that they had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of thousands of stolen emails. You will hear testimony that Papadopoulos had Trump’s personal blessing for his meetings with Russians. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

Coming from foreigners, the “dirt” wasn’t simply opposition research; it was the fruit of a crime—emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. All of this was part of a well-organized, wide-ranging and criminal effort by Russian operatives to meddle in the American election in dozens of states. The events of June, 2016 , are of critical importance in this case. You will learn that on June 3, the Defendant’s son, Donald Trump Jr., received an email from co-conspirator Rob Goldstone, who represented a Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, a longtime friend of both Trump and Putin who had partnered with Trump on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant and urged him to seek the presidency. Goldstone’s email said that as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Trump,” he wanted to send Trump Jr. “information that would incriminate Hillary.” Goldstone, in an obvious reference to the stolen emails, described it as “high level and sensitive information.” Trump Jr. said the damaging information about Clinton would be especially helpful “later this summer”—when the conspiracy would pick up steam. On June 7, Goldstone and Trump Jr. exchanged follow-up emails arranging for a meeting to take place on June 9 at Trump Tower. Now, something else happened on June 7 that you will see video of in this case, because it is incriminating in the context of the rest of the evidence. On June 7, four days after Goldstone offered the Trump campaign the “dirt”—emails on Hillary Clinton—and on the same day the campaign made arrangements to receive it, Defendant Trump had just won the New Jersey Republican primary. He decided to give a little preview of the next week and announced that on the following Monday, he would give “a major speech” in which he would be “discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.” Publicly discussing the stolen emails was so obviously illegal and thus harmful to his campaign that cooler heads prevailed; the “major speech” never happened. But the evidence will show that Trump was fully aware of the existence of the stolen emails and prepared to use them—like an accomplice to a bank robbery planning to spend the money stolen from the bank. Two days later came the June 9 meeting at Trump Tower —a meeting that you will hear a lot about it this case. In attendance from the Trump campaign were Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner, the candidate’s son-in-law. Trump himself was fully apprised of the meeting. Having provided the “quid”—the stolen emails—the Russians in attendance wanted to discuss the “quo”—the lifting of sanctions against Russian oligarchs. At this point in the case, we will ask you to shift your attention forward by a year, to July 8, 2017. Accounts of the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower have appeared in the press. Candidate Trump is now President Trump and he is flying aboard Air Force One and anxious to protect his son, his son-in-law and himself from legal trouble. You will hear testimony that the Defendant Trump and his staff knew exactly what they were doing in covering up the truth about the June 9 meeting. You will also learn that the statement Trump helped concoct proves a major overt act of the conspiracy. To avoid having Donald Jr. admit that the group had discussed receiving the stolen emails, President Trump and his aides claimed the subject of the meeting was “adoption.” By the end of this trial, you will have heard many examples of Defendant Trump’s lies. But this statement was actually true, though woefully incomplete. The June 9 meeting involved both a criminal discussion of stolen emails and a criminal discussion of adoption. Defendant Trump knew of and approved both ends of the quid pro quo. In this part of the case, you will learn about the Magnitsky Act . It was named for a Russian lawyer and dissident who died in 2009 in police custody in Moscow. After the Magnitsky Act was signed by President Obama in 2012, President Putin retaliated by banning the adoption of Russian infants by American parents. This eventually led to the poison promises at the center of the conspiracy: In exchange for a promise to lift the Magnitsky Act and other sanctions if Trump won the election, the Russians promised to release more stolen emails harmful to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and—of more interest to infertile American parents than Trump campaign operatives—to resume permission for adoption of Russian babies. The Russians didn’t wait long to fulfill their end of the corrupt bargain. Less than a week after the Trump Tower meeting, they began releasing the stolen emails through WikiLeaks and a Russian-connected hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 . The leaks accelerated the following month on the eve of the Democratic Convention. Defendant Trump’s old friend and longtime political dirty tricks operative, Roger Stone, knew about the stolen emails from an early point. He communicated with both WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2.0.. You will learn that his alibi has collapsed. More illegal collusion with the Russians took place through Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group, all hired for the campaign by Jared Kushner[1] and Steve Bannon. These firms—employing Russians—wrongly used data from as many as 50 million Facebook users on behalf of the Trump campaign which also improperly used the National Rifle Association to raise Russian money. Several of the elements of the criminal conspiracy took place in full public view, as the Defendant Trump sought to “hide in plain sight.” On July 30, 2016, Trump publicly encouraged the Russian government to continue its hacking operations and “to find the 30,000 emails that are missing” from Clinton’s private email server. Had this invitation to a hostile foreign power to hack into an American election taken place in private, it would have been considered damning evidence. It is no less incriminating for having been offered in public. The same goes for another public act in this time period—the changing of the Republican Party platform to water down its long-standing criticism of Russian aggression against Crimea and Ukraine. You will learn from the testimony of Republican delegates that this sharp departure from Republican Party principles came at Candidate Trump’s personal direction. He ordered no other changes in the party platform, which is viewed abroad as an important indication of government policy should that party come to power. Had he delivered this radical change in policy to the Russians in private, it would have been viewed as criminal inducement. The public version is, too. Throughout this trial, please keep in mind that not only has the Defendant Trump as president favored lifting of sanctions on Russia , he has refused to acknowledge what every intelligence agency has confirmed—that Russia attacked the American electoral system in 2016 on behalf of the Trump campaign. From the beginning of the campaign until the present, Trump—who routinely blasts even members of his own party and staff—has not uttered a word of criticism of Russia or Putin. The Defendant knows that any criticism of Putin risks exposure of Russia’s extensive financial stakes in his businesses. That conspiracy continued at least through the fall and winter of 2016-2017. In September and October of 2016, Donald Trump Jr. had direct secret communications with WikiLeaks. His father, Defendant Trump, mentioned WikiLeaks 160 times on the campaign trail and encouraged voters to read the stolen emails on the WikiLeaks site. His frequent exclamation, “I love WikiLeaks!” is more ‘hiding in plain sight’ and bolsters the case against him. The evidence of the conspiracy with the Russians will become even more clear when you learn of the events of October 7, 2016. That day, The Washington Post released the so-called Access Hollywood tape that threatened to end Trump’s campaign. Within 29 minutes of the release of the video, WikiLeaks—in collaboration with the Trump campaign—began releasing stolen emails from John Podesta, an obvious effort to deflect attention away from the damaging sex story. For the last month of the campaign, those emails were dribbled out to combat every negative story about Defendant Trump. None of this was a coincidence. We will introduce into evidence a December 2016 email from K.T. McFarland, Trump’s incoming deputy national security adviser, admitting that Russia had just “thrown the U.S.A. election” to Trump. You will learn that during and just after the election, the Trump team upheld its end of the corrupt bargain by making sure that lifting sanctions was a priority for the new administration. This involved 32 contacts between Russians and Trump campaign and transition officials—many of them recorded by the U.S. government—and 20 meetings. That’s about 19 more meetings than any other campaign—Republican or Democratic—has ever held with that hostile power. What did all of those meetings concern? Not vodka and ice hockey. Of course the Trump team didn’t want anyone to know about the communications. You will hear testimony that Jared Kushner tried to set up a secret backchannel communications system with the Russians, then lied about it; Erik Prince, a military contractor, did set up such a communications link on Trump’s behalf in the Seychelles Islands, then lied about it; and Michael Flynn, the incoming national security adviser, repeatedly assured his Russian friends—before and after the election—that sanctions would soon be lifted, then lied about it. You have heard me talk a lot about conspiracy. Now what does that word mean legally? The Defendant Trump is charged in this case with conspiracy to violate the federal computer hacking statute known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and with conspiracy to defraud the government. While the judge will instruct you thoroughly on the law relating to these statutes at the conclusion of the trial, it is sufficient at this point to say that a conspiracy is simply an agreement to violate the law. To prove this conspiracy, you will hear testimony from many witnesses. Among the most important are: Papadopoulos, Flynn, deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer, who will testify to coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Defendant Trump is also charged with obstruction of justice. You will hear voluminous testimony proving that charge from current and former high-level government officials present in the White House, at the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, New Jersey and aboard Air Force One when the crime occurred. Like his tweets and speeches mentioning Clinton emails and WikiLeaks, Trump’s “public evidence” against himself includes his interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, in which he admitted that he fired James Comey as FBI director over “this Russia thing”—that is, to stop the investigation into the criminal conspiracy. Finally, I want to speak to you as Americans. The fact that Defendant Trump is president of the United States should not deter you from seeking justice in this case. No person—no matter what his position—is above the law. All we ask is that you consider the totality of the evidence without fear, favor or prejudice. When you have gone through the process of reviewing all of the evidence, we are confident that you will find Donald John Trump guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Thank you.

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data “to target political advertising and manipulate voters.” The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques. But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states. Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum to leave the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify. The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February. “It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,” Mr. Collins said in a statement. “This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.” The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side. Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company’s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault. “This was unequivocally not a data breach,” tweeted Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive. “No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.” The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends — activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew. The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app’s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used. Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app “did not follow the data agreements.” Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted. “The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term,” Mr. Stamos tweeted. The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data. “Facebook’s platform must protect us from predatory behavior,” wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily, “or we can’t and shouldn’t trust the platform.” Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company’s platform could continue to be exploited. “Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few — if any — lasting repercussions,” Mr. Albright said. Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. “That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” he said. This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers. There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook’s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting — but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations. On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper’s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter. Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie. By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as “a curious and naïve 23-year-old,” when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica. “I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,” he added. “I need to make amends, and that’s why I’m coming forward.” His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data. Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted — a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting. In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it. Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data. “It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said. In the United States, the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article. Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election — Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California — called for investigations of the Facebook data leak. “This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,” said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.

Photograph: Noah Berger/Reuters The co-director of a company that harvested data from tens of millions of Facebook users before selling it to the controversial data analytics firms Cambridge Analytica is currently working for the tech giant as an in-house psychologist. ‘I made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool’: meet the data war whistleblower Read more Joseph Chancellor was one of two founding directors of Global Science Research (GSR), the company that harvested Facebook data using a personality app under the guise of academic research and later shared the data with Cambridge Analytica . He was hired to work at Facebook as a quantitative social psychologist around November 2015, roughly two months after leaving GSR, which had by then acquired data on millions of Facebook users. Chancellor is still working as a researcher at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters in California, where psychologists frequently conduct research and experiments using the company’s vast trove of data on more than 2 billion users. It is not known how much Chancellor knew of the operation to harvest the data of more than 50 million Facebook users and pass their information on to the company that went on to run data analytics for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Chancellor was a director of GSR along with Aleksandr Kogan, a more senior Cambridge University psychologist who is said to have devised the scheme to harvest Facebook data from people who used a personality app that was ostensibly acquiring data for academic research. On Friday, Facebook announced it had suspended both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica from using the platform, pending an investigation. Facebook said in a statement Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties. Kogan maintains that he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook. Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor – Kogan’s business partner at the time their company acquired the data, using an app called thisisyourdigitallife. Cambridge Analytica – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used the data to build sophisticated psychological profiles of US voters. Facebook’s deputy general counsel has described the data harvesting scheme as “a scam” and “a fraud” . He singled out Kogan, an assistant professor at Cambridge University, as having “lied to us and violated our platform policies” by passing the data on to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook’s public statements have omitted any reference to GSR, the company Kogan incorporated in May 2014 with Chancellor, who at the time was a postdoctoral research assistant. The Guardian asked Facebook several questions about its recruitment of Chancellor and any action it had taken in light of the data harvesting scam conducted by GSR. Facebook initially promised to respond to a set of questions by Sunday, but then said it had nothing to say on the matter. Chancellor did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The psychologist, who is 38, is understood to have been a junior partner to Kogan, who oversaw GSR’s business dealings and then elicited the help of several of his students. One source with some knowledge of Chancellor’s role at the company described him as “just the data guy”. However, both Kogan and Chancellor were listed as directors of GSR when it was founded and provided a “service address” in Harley Street, London. The property – 29 Harley Street – reportedly operates as “as a large, ornate and prestigiously located postbox and answerphone” for some 2,159 companies that are registered from the address but locate their operations elsewhere. Though potentially secretive, there is nothing unlawful about this process. In the months that followed the creation of GSR, the company worked in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica to pay hundreds of thousands of users to take the test as part of an agreement in which they agreed for their data to be collected for academic use. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions strong. That data sold to Cambridge Analytica as part of a commercial agreement. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. Chancellor resigned his directorship of GSR in September 2015, according to company records. He joined Facebook around November 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile . The following month, the Guardian published the first story detailing how Kogan and Chancellor’s company had unethically sourced data that was then passed to Cambridge Analytica, which at the time was working for the presidential campaign of Ted Cruz. Facebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor at that stage. His role at Facebook was mentioned in a story by the Intercept 12 months ago . At that time, Facebook said in a statement: “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook.” Chancellor, who was conducting postdoctoral research at Cambridge University when GSR was set up, is understood to have been one of several students who Kogan involved in his project. Data scandal is huge blow for Facebook – and efforts to study its impact on society Read more Since joining Facebook, some of Chancellor’s academic research has been published in peer-reviewed journals. However, the precise nature of his work for Facebook is unclear. The company employs many in-house social scientists to conduct research on the psychology of its users. In 2014, Facebook was revealed to have conducted a vast experiment on users , without their consent, which entailed tweaking the amount of positive and negative content appearing on their feeds to see if the tech giant could manipulate some kind of “emotional contagion”. Last year, leaked documents revealed how Facebook had told advertisers they had the capacity to monitor posts in real time and identify when teenage users were feeling “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. That kind of finite information is invaluable to advertisers – whether selling products or political candidates – as it helps them more effectively tailor and target their message to individual users on the platform. Facebook’s ability to create granular profiles of its users has been at the very core of its business model, transforming the social media platform into one of the most profitable companies on the planet.
